“See that bird?” he says. “It’s a Spencer’s warbler.” (I knew he didn’t know the real name.) “Well, in Italian, it’s a Chutto Lapittida. In Portuguese, it’s a Bom da Peida. In Chinese, it’s a Chung-long-tah, and in Japanese, it’s a Katano Tekeda. You can know the name of that bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird. You’ll only know about humans in different places, and what they call the bird. So let’s look at the bird and see what it’s doing—that’s what counts.” (I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.)

那么如何描述自己才能有趣呢？我的体会就是真实以及细节—真实的样子、真实的感觉和真实的过程，并且把这些细致入微地表现出来。乏味的人往往是千篇一律的，而有趣的人却各不相同，因为每个人本来就不同，乏味的其实只是看待自己的方式。迷男方法里有这样一个例子，当她询问你的职业时，你可以只回答一个词“经纪人”，也可以把这三个字丰富成一个关于理想与现实的成长故事。前一种回答只说明你是千千万万经纪人中的一员，后一种回答却带出了一个独一无二的自己。孰优孰劣，是不是一目了然呢。另外，也要提醒一下别只表现优点，那样容易显得做作和自恋。 还有一项有效的辅助训练就是写作，搭讪班的老学员们在文采和搭讪上的进步是有目共睹的。一个原因就是写作时往往会对自我有深入关注。“我是谁？那一刻我到底是怎么回事？”这些思考过程以及答案全都是有价值的，再用到平时的搭讪聊天之中，往往就能形成有趣的谈资。

对方经常会问“为什么？”我当初面对这种问题，最直接的反应就是“不为什么，就是想认识一下。”但屡次失败之后，才发现还是其他的套路更好用一些，比如“刚才在那边看见你了，觉得你很特别，所以我一咬牙就跑过来了。”

Everyone here complains of the heat, and concerned about whether you can stand it, when in fact it is just like Pasadena but about 5 degrees cooler on the average. So all stores and offices close from perhaps 1:30 pm to 5:30 pm (”because of the heat”). It turns out to be really a good idea (everyone takes a nap) because then they go late into the night—supper is between 9:30 and 10 pm, when it is cool. Right now, people here are seriously complaining about a new law: to save energy, all restaurants and taverns must close at 2 am. This, they say, will spoil life in Athens.

突然间，马蹄急响，辔铃轻震，一匹马飞云般自黑暗中冲出来。 　　马上人明眸如秋水，瞟了他一眼，突然一声轻喝，怒马已人立而起，硬生生停在他身旁。 　　好俊的马，好俊的骑术。 　　叶开微笑着，道：“姑奶奶居然还没有摔死，难得难得。” 　　马芳铃眼睛铜铃般瞪着他，冷笑道：“你这阴魂不散，怎么还没有走？” 　　叶开笑道：“还未见着马大小姐的芳容，又怎舍得走？” 　　马芳铃怒叱道：“好个油嘴滑舌的下流胚，看我打不死你。” 　　她长鞭又挥起，灵蛇般向叶开抽了过来。 　　叶开笑道：“下流胚都打不死的。” 　　这句话还没说完，他的人忽然已上了马背，紧贴在马芳铃身后。 　　马芳铃一个肘拳向后击出，怒道：“你想于什么？” 　　她肘拳击出，手臂就已被捉住。 　　叶开轻轻道：“月黑风高，我已找不出回去的路，就烦大小姐载我一程如何？” 　　马芳铃咬着牙，恨恨道：“你最好去死。” 　　她又一个肘拳击出，另一条手臂也被捉住，竟连动都没法子动了。 　　只觉得一阵阵男人的呼吸，吹在她脖子上，吹着她的发根。 　　她想缩起脖子，想用力往后撞，但也不知为了什么，全身竟偏偏连一点力气都使不出来。 　　座下的胭脂奴，想必也是匹雌马，忽然也变得温柔起来，踩着细碎的脚步，慢慢地往前走。 　　草原上一片空阔，远处一点点火光闪动，就仿佛是海上的渔火。 　　秋风迎面吹过来，也似已变得很温柔，温柔得仿佛春风。 　　她忽然觉得很热，咬着嘴唇，恨恨道：“你……你究竟放不放开我的手？” 　　叶开道：“不放。” 　　马芳铃道：“你这下流胚，你这无赖，你再不下去，我就要叫了。” 　　她本想痛骂他一顿的，但她的声音连自己听了，都觉得很温柔。 　　这又是为了什么？ 　　叶开笑道：“你不会叫的，何况，你就算叫，也没有人听得见。” 　　马芳铃道：“你……你……你想干什么？” 　　叶开道：“什么都不想。” 　　他的呼吸也仿佛春风般温柔，慢慢地接着道：“你看，月光这么淡，夜色这么凄凉，一个长在天涯流浪的人，忽然遇着了你这么样一个女孩子，又还能再想什么？” 　　马芳铃的呼吸忽然急促起来，想说话，又怕声音颤抖。 　　叶开忽又道：“你的心在跳。” 　　马芳铃用力咬着嘴唇，道：“心不跳，岂非是个死人了？” 　　叶开道：“但你的心却跳得特别快。” 　　马芳铃道：“我……” 　　叶开道：“其实你用不着说出来，我也明白你的心意。” 　　马芳铃道：“哦？” 　　叶开道：“你若不喜欢我，刚才就不会勒马停下，现在也不会让这匹马慢慢的走。” 　　马芳铃道：“我……我应该怎么样？” 　　叶开道：“你只要打一声呼哨，这匹马就会让我掉下去。” 　　马芳铃忽然一笑，道：“多谢你提醒了我。” 　　她一声呼哨，马果然轻嘶着，人立而起。 　　叶开果然从马背上摔了下去。 　　她自己也摔了下去，恰巧跌在叶开怀里。 　　只听辔铃声响，这匹马已放开四蹄，跑走了。 　　叶开叹了口气，喃喃道：“只可惜我还忘记提醒你一件事，我若摔下来，你也会摔下来的。” 　　马芳铃咬着牙，恨恨道：“你真是下流胚，真是个大无赖……” 　　叶开道：“但却是个很可爱的无赖，是不是？” 　　马芳铃道：“而且很不要脸。” 　　话未说完，她自己忽也“噗哧”一声笑了，脸却也烧得飞红。 　　如此空阔的大草原，如此清凉的月色，如此寂寞的秋夜……你却叫一个情窦初开的少女，怎么能硬得起心肠来，推开一个她并不讨厌的男人。 　　一个又坏，又特别的男人。 　　马芳铃忽然轻轻叹息了一声，道：“你这样的人，我真没看见过。” 　　叶开道：“我这样的男子本来不多。” 　　马芳铃道：“你对别的女人，也像对我这样子的吗？” 　　叶开道：“我若看见每个女人都像这样子，头早已被人打扁了。” 　　马芳铃又咬起嘴唇，道：“你以为我不会打扁你的头？” 　　叶开道：“你不会的。” 　　马芳铃道：“你放开我的手，看我打不打扁你？” 　　叶开的手已经放开了。 　　她扭转身，扬起手，一巴掌掴了下去。 　　她的手扬得很高，但落下去时却很轻。 　　叶开也没有闪避，只是静静地坐在地上，静静地凝视着她。 　　她的眸子在黑暗中亮如明星。 　　风在吹，月光更远。

The next week, she reported no success. Around dinnertime, she would tell herself, “I will definitely go to sleep earlier tonight,” but by eleven p.m., that resolve was nowhere to be found. I asked Lisa to describe the process of how she wasn’t going to bed early. She told me about the million and one things that each seemed more critically urgent the later the night got. Browsing Facebook, cleaning the fridge, tackling the stack of junk mail, even watching infomercials—none of this stuff was actually urgent, but late at night, it felt strangely compelling. Lisa was hooked on doing “one more thing” before she went to sleep. The later it got, and the more tired Lisa got, the less she was able to resist the immediate gratification that each task promised. When we redefined getting more sleep as a won’t power challenge, things turned around. Forcing herself to go to sleep wasn’t the real problem, it was pulling herself away from the things keeping her up. Lisa set a rule of turning off her computer and TV and not starting any new projects after eleven p.m. This rule was exactly what she needed to feel how tired she really was and give herself permission to go to bed by midnight. With seven hours of sleep each night, Lisa found that infomercials and other late-night temptations lost their appeal. Within a couple of weeks, she had the energy to tackle the next willpower challenge: cutting back on diet soda and drive-through dinners.

反映了一个非常奇怪的现象。增加成效有两种顺序互相颠倒 的办法： 1．只做重要的事情以减少工作时间（80/20 法则）。 2．减少工作时间来做最重要的事情（帕金森法则）。 最好的解决办法是两个一起用：确定几件影响收入的重要事情， 用非常短和清楚的时限来计划它们。 如果还没有正确选定目标重要的任务，就莽撞地开始和结束， 那些不重要的事情就会摇身变成重要的事情。即使你知道什么 才是重要的事情，但如果没有设定完成任务的时限，那些强加 到身上的（或突发的）次要事情就会不断地出现，不断占有你 的时间，一天下来你会一事无成。除了去 UPS 寄一个包裹、 预约几次会面和查阅电子邮件之外，朝九晚五的一整天还能干 什么呢？不要感到难过。过去，我好几个月都在干这样那样的 次要事情，感觉好像是公司在管理我，而不是我在管理公司。 80/20 法则和帕金森法则是两个重要的基础概念，在这一部分 里，我们还会看到它们的不同形式。大部分的投入都是无用功，

想象一下，现在我们能每秒钟播放24幅不同形态的马的图片，这就是一种由量变导致的质变：一部电影与一幅静态的画有本质上的区别！大数据也一样，量变导致质变。物理学和生物学都告诉我们，当我们改变规模时，事物的状态有时也会发生改变。 我们就以纳米技术为例。纳米技术专注于把东西变小而不是变大。其原理就是当事物到达分子的级别时，它的物理性质就会发生改变。一旦你知道这些新的性质，你就可以用同样的原料来做以前无法做的事情。铜本来是用来导电的物质，但它一旦到达纳米级别就不能在磁场中导电了。银离子具有抗菌性，但当它以分子形式存在的时候，这种性质会消失。一旦到达纳米级别，金属可以变得柔软，陶土可以具有弹性。同样，当我们增加所利用的数据量时，我们就可以做很多在小数据量的基础上无法完成的事情。

在哲学界，关于因果关系是否存在的争论已经持续了几个世纪。毕竟，如果凡事皆有因果的话，那么我们就没有决定任何事的自由了。如果说我们做的每一个决定或者每一个想法都是其他事情的结果，而这个结果又是由其他原因导致的，以此循环往复，那么就不存在人的自由意志这一说了——所有的生命轨迹都只是受因果关系的控制了。因此，对于因果关系在世间所扮演的角色，哲学家们争论不休，有时他们认为，这是与自由意志相对立的。当然，关于理论的争辩并不是我们要研究的重点。

比如说，大数据强烈诱使我们隔离那些被预言将会犯罪的人们，以减少风险的名义对其进行不断审查，即使他们确实在为尚不需承担责任的事情接受惩罚。设想一下，“预测警务”的运算法则鉴定某个青少年在未来五年内很可能犯重罪。结果，当局决定派遣一名社会工作者每月拜访他一次以对其进行监视，并尽力帮助他解决问题。如果该少年及其亲属、朋友、老师或雇主将这种拜访视为一种耻辱（这种情况极有可能发生），那么这就起到了惩罚的作用，的确是对未发生的行为的惩罚。然而，如果这种拜访完全不被视为惩罚，而只是为了减少问题出现的可能，即作为一种将风险降至最低的方式（在这里指的是将破坏公共安全的犯罪风险减到最小），情况照样好不到哪儿去。社会越是用干预、降低风险的方式取代为自己的行为负责，就越会导致个人责任意识的贬值。主张预测的国家是保姆式的国家，而且远不止如此。否认个人为其行为承担责任实际上就是在摧毁人们自由选择行为的权利。 如果国家做出的许多决策都是基于预测以及减少风险的愿望，就不存在所谓个人的选择了，也不用提自主行为的权利。无罪，无清白。如此一来，世界不止不会进步，反而在倒退。

Rain had become something entirely different. Snow! We are all, at heart, gradualists, our expectations set by the steady passage of time. But the world of the Tipping Point is a place where the unexpected becomes expected,where radical change is more than possibility. It is—contrary to all our expectations—a certainty.

The idea was that when the packet finally arrived at the stockbroker’s house, Milgram could look at the list of all those whose hands it went through to get there and establish how closely connected someone chosen at random from one part of the country was to another person in another part of the country. Milgram found that most of the letters reached the stockbroker in five or six steps. This experiment is where we get the concept of six degrees of separation.

Six degrees of separation doesn’t mean that everyone is linked to everyone else in just six steps. It means that a very small number of people are linked to everyone else in a few steps, and the rest of us are linked to the world through those special few.

This much is not surprising; the best way to get in the door is through a personal contact. But, curiously, Granovetter found that of those personal connections, the majority were “weak ties.” Of those who used a contact to find a job, only 16.7 percent saw that contact “often”—as they would if the contact were a good friend—and 55.6 percent saw their contact only “occasionally.” Twenty eight percent saw the contact “rarely.” People weren’t getting their jobs through their friends. They were getting them through their acquaintances.

OUR CONTRARIAN QUESTION—What important truth do very few people agree with you on?—is difficult to answer directly. It may be easier to start with a preliminary: what does everybody agree on? “Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule,” Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad). If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.

Compare the value of the New York Times Company with Twitter. Each employs a few thousand people, and each gives millions of people a way to get news. But when Twitter went public in 2013, it was valued at $24 billion—more than 12 times the Times’s market capitalization—even though the Times earned $133 million in 2012 while Twitter lost money. What explains the huge premium for Twitter? The answer is cash flow. This sounds bizarre at first, since the Times was profitable while Twitter wasn’t. But a great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future. Investors expect Twitter will be able to capture monopoly profits over the next decade, while newspapers’ monopoly days are over.

when people lack concrete plans to carry out, they use formal rules to assemble a portfolio of various options. This describes Americans today. In middle school, we’re encouraged to start hoarding “extracurricular activities.” In high school, ambitious students compete even harder to appear omnicompetent. By the time a student gets to college, he’s spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse résumé to prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he’s ready—for nothing in particular. A definite view, by contrast, favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive—to be a monopoly of one. This is not what young people do today, because everyone around them has long since lost faith in a definite world. No one gets into Stanford by excelling at just one thing, unless that thing happens to involve throwing or catching a leather ball.

I may sometimes be a little awkward, but there’s nothing self-conscious in my love of country. I am a quiet man—but I hear the quiet people others don’t. The ones who raise the family, pay the taxes, meet the mortgage. I hear them and I am moved, and their concerns are mine.”

Thankfully, the United States had a President suited to the moment. Within months of taking office, George Bush had the vision to recognize Gorbachev’s potential, the diplomatic savvy to help him, the humility to avoid provocation, and the strength of character to stand up to pressure from critics. The President who guided the Cold War to a peaceful end was the same decent, humble, thoughtful man that I have known all my life. It’s no exaggeration to say that the lessons that Dorothy Walker Bush taught her son a lifetime earlier—win with grace, don’t brag, think of the other guy—directly contributed to the peace of the world. Not too many mothers can say that.

Eventually he could no longer walk and had to use a wheelchair. Still, he lives joyfully. Sitting in his wheelchair, he realized that his socks were among the most visible parts of his wardrobe. So he started wearing brightly colored socks. His favorites are red, white, and blues. Even though it is a struggle for him to climb in and out of his wheelchair, he accepts invitations to public events. After all, he is the President who signed the Americans with Disabilities Act. He continues his prolific correspondence and constantly entertains people in Houston and especially at Walker’s Point. As always, he has a special place in his heart for those who were suffering. When he learned that one of his Secret Service agents had a two-year-old son undergoing treatment for leukemia, my eighty-nine-year-old father shaved his head in solidarity with the boy.

Sure enough, when, on a beautiful sunny day in Dallas, the current and former Presidents gathered at SMU, George H.W. Bush was there. He had battled through the illness and regained his strength. He was in his wheelchair sitting tall. When it was his turn to speak, his voice was strong. “It’s a great pleasure to be here to honor our son, our oldest son,” he said, trying hard to control his emotions. “This is very special for Barbara and me…. We’re glad to be here. God bless America, and thank you very much.” The crowd gave him a standing ovation. I cherished the moment, which a few months earlier had seemed like an unlikely dream. Then he turned to me. “Too long?” he asked with a twinkle in his eye. “Perfect, Dad,” I said.

Without trying very hard, you can find someone pulling down his pants and pooping in between parked cars or encounter some deranged sort bashing his head into the side of a bus stop. At dive bars near the local strip clubs, transvestites hit on curious businessmen and drunks fall asleep on couches and soil themselves as part of their lazy Sunday ritual. It’s the gritty, knife-stabby part of San Francisco and turned out to be a great place to watch the dotcom dream die. San Francisco has an enduring history with greed. It became a city on the back of the gold rush, and not even a catastrophic earthquake could slow San Francisco’s economic lust for long. Don’t let the granola vibes fool you. Booms and busts are the rhythm of this place. And, in 2000, San Francisco had been overtaken by the boom of all booms and consumed by avarice. It was a wonderful time to be alive with just about the entire populace giving in to a fantasy—a get-rich-quick, Internet madness. The pulses of energy from this shared delusion were palpable, producing a constant buzz that vibrated across the city. And here I was in the center of the most depraved part of San Francisco, watching just how high and low people get when consumed by excess.

By rights, Musk should have been part of the malaise. He jumped right into dot-com mania in 1995, when, fresh out of college, he founded a company called Zip2—a primitive Google Maps meets Yelp. That first venture ended up a big, quick hit. Compaq bought Zip2 in 1999 for $307 million. Musk made $22 million from the deal and poured almost all of it into his next venture, a start-up that would morph into PayPal. As the largest shareholder in PayPal, Musk became fantastically well-to-do when eBay acquired the company for $1.5 billion in 2002. Instead of hanging around Silicon Valley and falling into the same funk as his peers, however, Musk decamped to Los Angeles. The conventional wisdom of the time said to take a deep breath and wait for the next big thing to arrive in due course. Musk rejected that logic by throwing $100 million into SpaceX, $70 million into Tesla, and $10 million into SolarCity. Short of building an actual money-crushing machine, Musk could not have picked a faster way to destroy his fortune.

There would be a bit of hiking over the weekend. Then the relaxation would end. Musk would fly with the boys back to Los Angeles on Sunday afternoon. Then, he would take off on his own that evening for New York. Sleep. Hit the morning talk shows on Monday. Meetings. E-mail. Sleep. Fly back to Los Angeles Tuesday morning. Work at SpaceX. Fly to San Jose Tuesday afternoon to visit the Tesla Motors factory. Fly to Washington, D.C., that night and see President Obama. Fly back to Los Angeles Wednesday night. Spend a couple of days working at SpaceX.

Musk does not own a home in Northern California and ends up staying at the luxe Rosewood hotel or at friends’ houses. To arrange the stays with friends, Musk’s assistant will send an e-mail asking, “Room for one?” and if the friend says, “Yes,” Musk turns up at the door late at night. Most often he stays in a guest room, but he’s also been known to crash on the couch after winding down with some video games. Then it’s back to Los Angeles and SpaceX on Thursday. He shares custody of his five young boys—twins and triplets—with his ex-wife, Justine, and has them four days a week. Each year, Musk tabulates the amount of flight time he endures per week to help him get a sense of just how out of hand things are getting. Asked how he survives this schedule, Musk said, “I had a tough childhood, so maybe that was helpful.”

When Musk came into the meeting room where I’d been waiting, I noted how impressive it was for so many people to turn up on a Saturday. Musk saw the situation in a different light, complaining that fewer and fewer people had been working weekends of late. “We’ve grown fucking soft,” Musk replied. “I was just going to send out an e-mail. We’re fucking soft.” (A word of warning: There’s going to be a lot of “fuck” in this book. Musk adores the word, and so do most of the people in his inner circle.)

Musk often makes sure that people know he had some truly big ideas on his mind during this period of his life. As he tells it, he would daydream at Queen’s and Penn and usually end up with the same conclusion: he viewed the Internet, renewable energy, and space as the three areas that would undergo significant change in the years to come and as the markets where he could make a big impact. He vowed to pursue projects in all three. “I told all my ex-girlfriends and my ex-wife about these ideas,” he said. “It probably sounded like super-crazy talk.”

It had taken Musk less than a decade to go from being a Canadian backpacker to becoming a multimillionaire at the age of twenty-seven. With his $22 million, he moved from sharing an apartment with three roommates to buying an 1,800-square-foot condo and renovating it. He also bought a $1 million McLaren F1 sports car and a small prop plane and learned to fly. Musk embraced the newfound celebrity that he’d earned as part of the dot-com millionaire set. He let CNN show up at his apartment at 7 A.M. to film the delivery of the car. A black eighteen-wheeler pulled up in front of Musk’s place and then lowered the sleek, sliver vehicle onto the street, while Musk stood slack-jawed with his arms folded. “There are sixty-two McLarens in the world, and I will own one of them,” he told CNN. “Wow, I can’t believe it’s actually here. That’s pretty wild, man.”

Musk purchased the McLaren from a seller in Florida, snatching the car away from Ralph Lauren, who had also inquired about buying it. Even very wealthy people like Lauren would tend to reserve something like a McLaren for special events or the occasional Sunday drive. Not Musk. He drove it all around Silicon Valley and parked it on the street by the X.com offices. His friends were horrified to see such a work of art covered with bird droppings or in the parking lot of a Safeway.

There were practical reasons for this decision. Investors catch a break under the tax law if they roll a windfall into a new venture within a couple of months. But even by Silicon Valley’s high-risk standards, it was shocking to put so much of one’s newfound wealth into something as iffy as an online bank. All told, Musk invested about $12 million into X.com, leaving him, after taxes, with $4 million or so for personal use. “That’s part of what separates Elon from mere mortals,” said Ed Ho, the former Zip2 executive, who went on to cofound X.com. “He’s willing to take an insane amount of personal risk. When you do a deal like that, it either pays off or you end up in a bus shelter somewhere.”

When the third chamber cracked, Musk flew the hardware back to California, took it to the factory floor, and, with the help of some engineers, started to fill the chambers with an epoxy to see if it would seal them. “He’s not afraid to get his hands dirty,” Mueller said. “He’s out there with his nice Italian shoes and clothes and has epoxy all over him. They were there all night and tested it again and it broke anyway.” Musk, clothes ruined, had decided the hardware was flawed, tested his hypothesis, and moved on quickly, asking the engineers to come up with a new solution.

What’s more, the founding team had no intention of turning to Detroit for advice on how to build a car company. No, Tesla would do what every other Silicon Valley start-up had done before it, which was hire a bunch of young, hungry engineers and figure things out as they went along. Never mind that the Bay Area had no real history of this model ever having worked for something like a car and that building a complex, physical object had little in common with writing a software application.

He didn’t just survive. He kept working and stayed focused.” That ability to stay focused in the midst of a crisis stands as one of Musk’s main advantages over other executives and competitors. “Most people who are under that sort of pressure fray,” Gracias said. “Their decisions go bad.

It’s one of the habits that got him in the most trouble as SpaceX and Tesla tried to bring their first products to market. Time and again, Musk found himself making a public appearance where he had to come up with a new batch of excuses for a delay. Reminded about the initial 2003 target date to fly the Falcon 1, Musk acted shocked. “Are you serious?” he said. “We said that? Okay, that’s ridiculous. I think I just didn’t know what the hell I was talking about. The only thing I had prior experience in was software, and, yeah, you can write a bunch of software and launch a website in a year.

Davis spent nine months building the actuator. At the end of the process, he toiled for three hours writing an e-mail to Musk covering the pros and cons of the device. The e-mail went into gory detail about how Davis had designed the part, why he had made various choices, and what its cost would be. As he pressed send, Davis felt anxiety surge through his body knowing that he’d given his all for almost a year to do something an engineer at another aerospace company would not even attempt. Musk rewarded all of this toil and angst with one of his standard responses. He wrote back, “Ok.” The actuator Davis designed ended up costing $3,900 and flew with Falcon 1 into space. “I put every ounce of intellectual capital I had into that e-mail and one minute later got that simple response,” Davis said. “Everyone in the company was having that same experience. One of my favorite things about Elon is his ability to make enormous decisions very quickly. That is still how it works today.”

Musk told me that the idea originated out of his hatred for California’s proposed high-speed rail system. “The sixty-billion-dollar bullet train they’re proposing in California would be the slowest bullet train in the world at the highest cost per mile,” Musk said. “They’re going for records in all the wrong ways.” California’s high-speed rail is meant to allow people to go from Los Angeles to San Francisco in about two and a half hours upon its completion in—wait for it—2029. It takes about an hour to fly between the cities today and five hours to drive, placing the train right in the zone of mediocrity, which particularly gnawed at Musk. He insisted the Hyperloop would cost about $6 billion to $10 billion, go faster than a plane, and let people drive their cars onto a pod and drive out into a new city.

The granddaddy example of Musk’s seemingly callous interoffice style occurred in early 2014 when he fired Mary Beth Brown. To describe her as a loyal executive assistant would be grossly inadequate. Brown often felt like an extension of Musk—the one being who crossed over into all of his worlds. For more than a decade, she gave up her life for Musk, traipsing back and forth between Los Angeles and Silicon Valley every week, while working late into the night and on weekends. Brown went to Musk and asked that she be compensated on par with SpaceX’s top executives, since she was handling so much of Musk’s scheduling across two companies, doing public relations work and often making business decisions. Musk replied that Brown should take a couple of weeks off, and he would take on her duties and gauge how hard they were. When Brown returned, Musk let her know that he didn’t need her anymore, and he asked Shotwell’s assistant to begin scheduling his meetings. Brown, still loyal and hurt, didn’t want to discuss any of this with me. Musk said that she had become too comfortable speaking on his behalf and that, frankly, she needed a life. Other people grumbled that Brown and Riley clashed and that this was the root cause of Brown’s ouster.*

When Musk announced in 2014 that Tesla would open-source all of its patents, analysts tried to decide whether this was a publicity stunt or if it hid an ulterior motive or a catch. But the decision was a straightforward one for Musk. He wants people to make and buy electric cars. Man’s future, as he sees it, depends on this. If open-sourcing Tesla’s patents means other companies can build electric cars more easily, then that is good for mankind, and the ideas should be free. The cynic will scoff at this, and understandably so. Musk, however, has been programmed to behave this way and tends to be sincere when explaining his thinking—almost to a fault.

Page said. “I think like we’re just not educating people in this kind of general way. You should have a pretty broad engineering and scientific background. You should have some leadership training and a bit of MBA training or knowledge of how to run things, organize stuff, and raise money. I don’t think most people are doing that, and it’s a big problem. Engineers are usually trained in a very fixed area. When you’re able to think about all of these disciplines together, you kind of think differently and can dream of much crazier things and how they might work. I think that’s really an important thing for the world. That’s how we make progress.”

There are times when you run into Musk and he looks utterly exhausted. He does not have bags under his eyes but rather deep, shadowy valleys. During the worst of times, following weeks of sleep deprivation, his eyes seem to have sunk back into his skull. Musk’s weight moves up and down with the stress, and he’s usually heavier when really overworked. It’s funny in a way that Musk spends so much time talking about man’s survival but isn’t willing to address the consequences of what his lifestyle does to his body. “Elon came to the conclusion early in his career that life is short,” Straubel said. “If you really embrace this, it leaves you with the obvious conclusion that you should be working as hard as you can.”

“They might have a little adversity at school, but these days schools are so protective,” he said. “If you call someone a name, you get sent home. When I was going to school, if they punched you and there was no blood, it was like, ‘Whatever. Shake it off.’ Even if there was a little blood, but not a lot, it was fine. What do I do? Create artificial adversity? How do you do that? The biggest battle I have is restricting their video game time because they want to play all the time. The rule is they have to read more than they play video games. They also can’t play completely stupid video games. There’s one game they downloaded recently called Cookies or something. You literally tap a fucking cookie. It’s like a Psych 101 experiment. I made them delete the cookie game. They had to play Flappy Golf instead, which is like Flappy Bird, but at least there is some physics involved.”

Musk has talked about having more kids, and it’s on this subject that he delivers some controversial philosophizing vis-à-vis the creator of Beavis and Butt-head. “There’s this point that Mike Judge makes in Idiocracy, which is like smart people, you know, should at least sustain their numbers,” Musk said. “Like, if it’s a negative Darwinian vector, then obviously that’s not a good thing. It should be at least neutral. But if each successive generation of smart people has fewer kids, that’s probably bad, too. I mean, Europe, Japan, Russia, China are all headed for demographic implosion. And the fact of the matter is that basically the wealthier—basically wealth, education, and being secular are all indicative of low birth rate. They all correlate with low birth rate. I’m not saying like only smart people should have kids. I’m just saying that smart people should have kids as well. They should at least maintain—at least be a replacement rate. And the fact of the matter is that I notice that a lot of really smart women have zero or one kid. You’re like, ‘Wow, that’s probably not good.’”

We all want to believe that the key to making an impact on someone lies with the inherent quality of the ideas we present. But in none of these cases did anyone substantially alter the content of what they were saying. Instead, they tipped the message by tinkering, on the margin, with the presentation of their ideas, by putting the Muppet behind the H U G, by mixing Big Bird with the adults, by repeating episodes and skits more than once, by having Steve pause just a second longer than normal after he asks a question, by putting a tiny gold box in the corner of the ad. The line between hostility and acceptance, in other words, between an epidemic that tips and one that does not, is sometimes a lot narrower than it seems. The creators of Sesame Street did not junk their entire show after the Philadelphia disaster. They just added Big Bird, and he made all the difference in the world. Howard Levanthal didn’t redouble his efforts to terrify his students into getting a tetanus shot. He just threw in a map and a set of appointment times. The Law of the Few says that there are exceptional people out there who are capable of starting epidemics. All you have to do is find them. The lesson of stickiness is the same. There is a simple way to package information that, under the right circumstances, can make it irresistible. All you have to do is find it.

The most intriguing candidate for that “something else” is called the Broken Windows theory. Broken Windows was the brainchild of the criminologists James Q. Wilson and George Kelling. Wilson and Kelling argued that crime is the inevitable result of disorder. If a window is broken and left unrepaired, people walking by will conclude that no one cares and no one is in charge. Soon, more windows will be broken, and the sense of anarchy will spread from the building to the street on which it faces, sending a signal that anything goes. In a city, relatively minor problems like graffiti, public disorder, and aggressive panhandling, they write, are all the equivalent of broken windows, invitations to more serious crimes:

We’re impressed with small feats accomplished by computers alone, but we ignore big achievements from complementarity because the human contribution makes them less uncanny. Watson, Deep Blue, and ever-better machine learning algorithms are cool. But the most valuable companies in the future won’t ask what problems can be solved with computers alone. Instead, they’ll ask: how can computers help humans solve hard problems?

OF THE SIX PEOPLE who started PayPal, four had built bombs in high school. Five were just 23 years old—or younger. Four of us had been born outside the United States. Three had escaped here from communist countries: Yu Pan from China, Luke Nosek from Poland, and Max Levchin from Soviet Ukraine. Building bombs was not what kids normally did in those countries at that time. The six of us could have been seen as eccentric. My first-ever conversation with Luke was about how he’d just signed up for cryonics, to be frozen upon death in hope of medical resurrection. Max claimed to be without a country and proud of it: his family was put into diplomatic limbo when the USSR collapsed while they were escaping to the U.S. Russ Simmons had escaped from a trailer park to the top math and science magnet school in Illinois. Only Ken Howery fit the stereotype of a privileged American childhood: he was PayPal’s sole Eagle Scout. But Kenny’s peers thought he was crazy to join the rest of us and make just one-third of the salary he had been offered by a big bank. So even he wasn’t entirely normal.

They say that a dying man reviews his life in the final seconds before his death. In my case this was not true. As we hurtled down towards becoming a fireball on the Atlas Mountains and I thought that we were going to die, all I could think of was that, if I escaped with my life, I would never do this again. As we rose up towards safety, Alex told us a story of a rich man who set out to swim the Channel: he went down to the beach, set up his deck chair and a table laid with cucumber sandwiches and strawberries, and then announced that his man would now swim the Channel for him. At that moment, it didn’t sound like such a bad idea.

My parents adored each other, and in my childhood there was barely a cross word between them. Eve, my mother, was always full of life and galvanised us.

Eve Huntley-Flindt had picked up some of her dazzling energy from her mother Dorothy, who holds two British records: aged 89 Granny became the oldest person in Britain to pass the advanced Latin-American ballroom-dancing examination, and aged 90 she became the oldest person to hit a hole in one at golf. Granny was 99 when she died. Shortly before that, she had written to me to say that the previous ten years had been the best of her life. That same year, on her way round the world on a cruise ship, she had been left behind in Jamaica with only her swimming costume on. She had even read A Brief History of Time (something which I’ve never been able to manage!). She never stopped learning. Her attitude was, you’ve got one go in life, so make the most of it.

Eve started looking for other, daytime, work, and went out to Heston where a gliding club taught RAF recruits to glide before they became pilots. She asked for a job as a pilot, but was told that these jobs were available only to men. Undeterred, she chatted up one of the instructors, who relented and secretly gave her the job so long as she pretended to be a boy. So, wearing a leather jacket, a leather helmet to hide her hair, and adopting a deep voice, Eve learnt how to glide and then began to teach the new pilots.

We slept in the car while they had dinner, but we always woke up when they started the drive back home. Lindi and I kept quiet and looked up at the night sky, listening to my parents talk and joke about their evening. We grew up talking as friends to our parents. As children we discussed Dad’s legal cases, and argued about pornography and whether drugs should be legalised long before any of us knew what we were really talking about. My parents always encouraged us to have our own opinions and rarely gave us advice unless we asked for it.

Sometimes we would slip upstairs to raid Jonny’s parents’ fridge. Mum would occasionally burst in through the door carrying a picnic hamper.

Sometimes we could even persuade them to come back to the flat, ‘for coffee’. If they stayed the night, the next morning we would try to persuade them to help out. For some reason, they often seemed to take pity on us. Word of mouth spread: old friends turned up from school; friends of friends, or people who had read the magazine, wanted to be involved. Increasingly, the basement resembled a squat. We all worked for no money, living off whatever was in the fridge and going out for cheap curries.

The Student Advisory Centre began to take up more time than Student magazine. I would be talking to possible suicides for an hour at three in the morning, advising pregnant girls as to who was the nicest doctor they could go and see, writing to someone who was terrified that he had caught venereal disease but didn’t dare tell his parents or go and see a doctor – and in what little time was left, trying to run the magazine. One of the biggest problems we found ourselves dealing with was that teenagers were unable to confide in their parents. Hearing others’ stories made me realise how lucky I was in my relationship with my own parents. They had never judged me, and always supported me, always praised the good things rather than criticised the bad things: I had no qualms about admitting my problems, worries and failures. Our work was to try to help out those who were in trouble but with nowhere to turn.

The owner was a large, square Greek called Mr Alachouzos. ‘You’ll never pay the rent,’ he said. ‘No, you’re right,’ I said. ‘We can’t afford any rent.

Since the studios were so overbooked, bands would often have to record straight after breakfast. The idea of The Rolling Stones having to record ‘Brown Sugar’ straight after finishing their bowls of cornflakes struck me as ridiculous. I imagined that the best environment for making records would be a big, comfortable house in the country where a band could come and stay for weeks at a time and record whenever they felt like it, probably in the evening. So during 1971 I started looking for a country house that I could convert into a recording studio.

Frank Zappa had made his reputation as one of the most original, innovative and irreverent performers in rock music. His albums, like We’re Only In It For The Money and Weasels Ripped My Flesh, were filled with biting satire, and when he came up to the Manor to investigate the possibilities of recording there I felt sure he would appreciate a joke. I drove Frank up from London myself, enthusing about the wonderful manor house in which the studio was situated. But, instead of taking the road to Shipton-on-Cherwell, I made a detour to nearby Woodstock. I turned off the road, under a majestic arch, and drove down a long, gravel driveway to the door of a magnificent house. ‘I’ll park the car,’ I told Frank. ‘Just knock on the door and tell them who you are.’ The door was opened by a uniformed footman. Funnily enough, he didn’t recognise Frank Zappa and was not amused to be told the long-haired musician had come to stay. Did Zappa know, the footman asked, that he was knocking at the door of Blenheim Palace, the ancestral seat of the Dukes of Marlborough? Frank got back into the car, swearing that he could see the funny side of it. But he never did record at the Manor.

I have always believed that the only way to cope with a cash crisis is not to contract but to try to expand out of it. ‘What about if we found ten more Mike Oldfields?’ I asked, teasing him. ‘How would that do?’ Ultimately, we had two options: either tuck away a little money and eke out a living without taking any more risks, or use our last few pounds to try to sign up another band that could break us back into the big time. If we chose the first option, we could get by: we would be running a tiny company, but we could survive and make a living without any risks attached. If we chose the second, Virgin could be bust within a few months, but at least we would have one last chance to break out.

Joan had been married to her husband, Ronnie Leahy, for almost eight years, but they had no children. Ronnie travelled a good deal, and it seemed to me, perhaps conveniently, that he and Joan had begun to drift apart. Whenever Ronnie was away, I called up Joan’s friends and asked whether they were seeing Joan. ‘Mind if I tag along?’ I asked casually. They soon called me ‘Tag-along’, which I really didn’t mind as long as by tagging along I had the chance to sit somewhere near Joan and talk with her. Our courtship was unlike the other romances I’d had, which I’d been able to control. Joan is an intensely private person, and it was extremely difficult to find out the state of her marriage. While I knew what I felt about her, I had very little idea what Joan made of me. I thought that she might be intrigued by my persistence, but beyond that I was in the dark. Eventually, Joan agreed to come with me to the Isle of Wight, and we spent the weekend in a tiny hotel in Bembridge. It was the start of our affair. Since Joan was married we both carried on living double lives. She could not see me during the week, when Ronnie was at home, but early one morning she decided to surprise me by dropping round to my house in Denbigh Terrace, where I was still living. As she let herself in, she saw my cleaning lady Martha going up the stairs to my bedroom carrying a tray with two cups of tea on it. Joan knew that I was in bed with another woman – which I was – so she stopped Martha and put a flower on the tray. ‘Just say to Richard that Joan says hello,’ she said, and then turned on her heel and went back to the shop. I was mortified. I dashed round to see her at Dodo and persuaded her to have lunch with me. ‘So what’s all this about undying love?’ Joan asked sarcastically. ‘Well, I was lonely,’ I said lamely. ‘I couldn’t wait until the weekend.’ ‘That’s a pathetic excuse!’ Joan said. I tried to look ashamed of myself and contrite, but we caught each other’s eye and then both burst out laughing.

On impulse, Joan and I decided to fly down to the Virgin Islands. We had nowhere to stay and not very much money, but I heard that if you expressed a serious interest in buying an island the local estate agent would put you up for nothing in a grand villa and fly you all around the Virgin Islands by helicopter. This sounded rather fun. I cheekily made a few calls, and, sure enough, when I introduced myself and mentioned The Sex Pistols and Mike Oldfield and that Virgin Music was really expanding and we wanted to buy an island where our rock stars could come and get away from it all, and perhaps put a recording studio there, the estate agent began to get very excited.

‘How much does he want for it?’ I asked. ‘£3 million.’ Our visions of watching the sunset from the top of the hill faded away. ‘Nice thought,’ Joan said, and we trudged back to the helicopter. ‘How much were you thinking of spending?’ the estate agent asked, suddenly smelling a rat. ‘We could offer £150,000,’ I said brightly. ‘$200,000,’ I added, trying to make it sound more. ‘I see.’ As we flew back to the villa, it was clear that we were no longer welcome. Talk of $200,000 wasn’t enough to secure us a night at the villa. Our bags were left at the door, and Joan and I hauled them across the village to a bed-and-breakfast. It was clear that there were going to be no more helicopter flights over the islands. Yet Joan and I were determined to buy Necker. We felt that it could be our secret hideaway island, somewhere we could always retreat to. So, although we were practically driven off the Virgin Islands as if we were cattle-rustlers, we vowed to return. Back in London, later, I found out that the owner of Necker Island wanted to sell in a hurry. He wanted to construct a building somewhere in Scotland which would cost him around £200,000. I upped my offer to £175,000 and held on for three months. Finally I got a call. ‘If you offer £180,000 it’s yours.’

By 1979, an outsider might have looked at Virgin and come to the conclusion that it was a motley collection of different companies. From our tiny mews house in Vernon Yard, we operated the record shops, which Nik ran; the record company, which was run by Simon and Ken; and the music publishing company, which was run by Carol Wilson. The Manor was going well, and we had expanded our recording business with the purchase of a London recording studio. The original plan to set up everything that a rock star needed, recording, publishing, distribution, and retailing, was beginning to work. On top of this we had also set up Virgin Book Publishing, which was primarily to publish books about music, and biographies and autobiographies of the rock stars. In lieu of The Sex Pistols’ future albums, which would now never be made, we had acquired the rights to the film which Malcolm McLaren was producing, The Great Rock And Roll Swindle. This guaranteed one last album, the film soundtrack. In order to pull this film together, we set up Virgin Films, which Nik started to manage.

Another venture that Nik had set up was The Venue, a nightclub where our bands could play and people could eat and socialise while watching them. As the world of rock music grew increasingly sophisticated, it became clear that bands no longer wanted simply to record their songs and then release them. Pop videos were becoming the most effective way of promoting songs, and some cynics observed that pop videos were as important as the music itself. In order to accommodate this, Nik also set up a film-editing studio where our bands could make and edit their own videos.

Although Virgin is not a family company in the traditional sense, in that it has not been passed down vertically from generation to generation, it is a family company in a horizontal sense, in that I always involve my wider family in whatever I do, and I listen to their opinions as closely as anyone else’s. I know that a number of businessmen shut their families off from their work: they hardly ever invite their children into their office, and when they are at home they never discuss what they do at work. It is a British characteristic not to discuss money over a meal, but when this boils over into never discussing business then I think it represents a lost opportunity. Business is a way of life. It is small wonder that there are so few business entrepreneurs when business is excluded from the family circle.

In the same way that I tend to make up my mind about people within thirty seconds of meeting them, I also make up my mind about whether a business proposal excites me within about thirty seconds of looking at it. I rely far more on gut instinct than researching huge amounts of statistics. This might be because, due to my dyslexia, I distrust numbers, which I feel can be twisted to prove anything. The idea of operating a Virgin airline grabbed my imagination, but I had to work out in my own mind what the potential risks were.

The only airline that was offering cheap fares across the Atlantic in 1984 was People Express. I picked up the phone and tried to call them. Their number was engaged. It was impossible to get through on their reservations line all morning. I reasoned that either People Express was very poorly managed, in which case they would be an easy target for new competition, or that they were so much in demand that there was room for new competition. It was that continual engaged tone on my telephone throughout Saturday more than anything else which triggered my belief that we could set up and run an airline.

Simon’s interest and love for life comes from the arts, from music, books, his collection of paintings and beautiful cars. My interest in life comes from setting myself huge, apparently unachievable, challenges and trying to rise above them. From a purely commercial perspective, Simon was absolutely right; but from the viewpoint of wanting to live life to the full, I felt I had to attempt it.

As Maiden Voyager taxied down the runway, the screen at the front of the cabin flickered into life and showed the backs of the pilots and the flight engineer as they sat in the flight deck and manned the controls. Over their shoulders we could see the view through the windscreen. An announcement came over the loudspeakers: ‘Since this is our first flight, we thought you might like to share our view from the flight deck, and see what really happens when we take off.’ We could see the view of the runway stretching out in front. Then we started speeding along: the tarmac rushing beneath the windscreen gathered pace until the white lines were just a blur. But the pilots seemed rather relaxed: rather than staring intently ahead and flying the plane, they started looking sideways at each other and smiling. One of them had very long hair beneath his cap; the other was a West Indian. We were now hurtling down the runway, and these two pilots were doing nothing about it. They were simply paying no attention. Everyone watching the screen held their breath: this was all some mad suicide flight by that lunatic Branson. There was a deathly hush. Then, just as the plane’s nose rose up and the runway began to disappear from view, the West Indian reached behind his ear, pulled out a joint, and offered it to his copilot. Before anyone was entirely sure that this was a joke, the plane took off and the two pilots took off their caps and turned round to face the camera: they were Ian Botham and Viv Richards. The bearded flight engineer was me. The whole plane rocked with laughter. We had filmed it the previous day on a flight simulator.

I AM OFTEN ASKED why I go in for record-breaking challenges with either powerboats or hot-air balloons. People point out that, with success, money, and a happy family, I should stop putting myself and them at risk and enjoy what I am so lucky to have. This is an obvious truth, and part of me wholeheartedly agrees with it. I love life; I love my family; and I am horrified by the idea of being killed and leaving Joan without a husband, and Holly and Sam without a father. But another part of me is driven to try new adventures, and I still find that I want to push myself to my limits. If I were to think about it more carefully, I would say that I love to experience as much as I can of life. The physical adventures I have been involved in have added a special dimension to my life that has reinforced the pleasure I take in my business. If I had refused to contemplate skydiving, hot-air ballooning or crossing the Atlantic in a boat, I think that my life would have been the duller for it. I never think that I am going to die by accident, but if I were to die then all I can say is that I was wrong, and the hardened realists who kept their feet on the ground were right. But at least I tried. Apart from the thrill of the actual event, I love the preparation for it. A tremendous sense of camaraderie builds up within the team when we are preparing for a challenge, and if we are going after a record there is not only the technological challenge but also a great feeling of patriotism as the public cheers us on. There used to be a great many British explorers, all in the best tradition of Scott of the Antarctic, and I feel proud to follow in their footsteps.

The next day, I consulted a premed adviser to figure out the logistics. Getting ready for medical school would take about a year of intense coursework, plus the application time, which added up to another eighteen months. It would mean letting my friends go to New York, to continue deepening those relationships, without me. It would mean setting aside literature. But it would allow me a chance to find answers that are not in books, to find a different sort of sublime, to forge relationships with the suffering, and to keep following the question of what makes human life meaningful, even in the face of death and decay. I began working through the necessary premedical courses, loading up on chemistry and physics. Reluctant to take a part-time job—it would slow my studies—but unable to afford Palo Alto rent, I found an open window in an empty dormitory and climbed in. After a few weeks of squatting, I was discovered by the caretaker—who happened to be a friend. She provided a key to the room and some useful warnings, like when the high school girls’ cheerleading camps would be coming through. Thinking it wise to avoid becoming a registered sex offender, I’d pack a tent, some books and granola, and head up to Tahoe until it was safe to return. Because the med school application cycle takes eighteen months, I had a free year once my classes were over. Several professors had suggested I pursue a degree in the history and philosophy of science and medicine before deciding to leave academia for good. So I applied for, and was accepted into, the HPS program at Cambridge. I spent the next year in classrooms in the English countryside, where I found myself increasingly often arguing that direct experience of life-and-death questions was essential to generating substantial moral opinions about them. Words began to feel as weightless as the breath that carried them. Stepping back, I realized that I was merely confirming what I already knew: I wanted that direct experience. It was only in practicing medicine that I could pursue a serious biological philosophy. Moral speculation was puny compared to moral action. I finished my degree and headed back to the States. I was going to Yale for medical school.

拖延者的信条 我必须要做到完美。 我做每件事都应该轻而易举，不费力气。 什么也不做，要比冒失败的风险更为安全。 没有什么是我无法做到的。 如果不能把事情做好，那么它就根本不值得去做。 我必须避开挑战。 如果我成功，有人就会受到伤害。 如果这一次我做得很好，那么我每次都应该做得很好。 按照别人的规定做事，意味着屈服和失去掌控。 我不能承受失去任何人或任何事物。 如果我展现真实的自己，人们不会喜欢我的。 总有一个正确答案，我将一直等待直到发现它。 这些假设你可能听上去很熟悉，也可能你并不知情，它们是通过你的潜意识运作的。不管怎样，它们并不是绝对真理；它们是为拖延开道的一些个人观念。如果你认为必须做到完美，那么你宁愿拖延着也不愿意去努力做事，不愿意冒风险被人评判你的失败。如果你相信成功是危险的，那么你就会通过拖延保护自己和他人，降低自己把事情做成的概率。如果你将合作等同于屈服，那么你就会一直把事情拖着，直到觉得你已经准备好了才去做它，以此来维护自己的掌控感；或者，如果你相信人们不会喜欢真实的你，那么你就会利用拖延保留你自己的想法并跟人们保持一个安全距离。

我们认为，人们之所以产生拖延的不良习性，是因为他们害怕。他们害怕如果他们行动了，他们的行为会让他们陷入麻烦。他们担心如果展示了自己真实的一面，会有危险的结果等着他们。在所有无序和拖拉的背后，他们其实在害怕他们不被接受，以至于他们不仅躲开这个世界，甚至还躲开他们自己。虽然要忍受自责、自轻和对自己的反感是相当痛苦的，但是，比起看清真实的自我所带来的脆弱和无地自容，这样的感受或许更能够被承受得起，拖延是保护他们的盾牌。

对于完美主义者，心理学家甄别出两种类型，一种是适应型的，一种是适应不良型的。 一个适应型的完美主义者对自己要求很高，并且相信自己的表现能够与之相符。这样一种能够如愿以偿的完美主义，感觉上去就像一个人本性的一部分，也是一个人自尊的基石。然而，一个适应不良的完美主义者对自己要求也很高，但是却对自己不抱希望。在适应不良型的完美主义中，你对自己的要求跟你对自己表现的期待之间存在着一种矛盾，所以你更容易去自责，也更容易感到消沉，你的自尊因而也处于较低的水平。

平庸招致轻蔑。对有些拖延者而言，平庸是无法忍受的，他们想要自己做的每一件事都非常出色，不但希望自己具有理想的事业和人际关系，还希望自己写得一手好信，培植一个好花园。如果你期望自己的日常表现都能达到理想的境地，那么不论你做什么，跟你的理想相比都是平庸的。你贬低平常与常规的表现，以轻蔑的眼光来看待它。因为在人类生活中错误和差池在所难免，所以那些不能忍受平常表现的人往往通过拖延来安慰自己。一个平平常常的表现，可以归因于最后阶段的时间局促，这样他们就可以继续相信，如果给自己足够多的时间，他们的理想还是可以实现的。这让完美主义者在他们表现平平的时候避免自己小看自己。

总有一个正确的解决办法。这是完美主义者最喜欢的观念之一。他们相信每个问题都有一个正确的解决办法，而找到这个办法就是他们的职责所在。在发现正确的解决办法之前，他们不愿意采取任何行动，也不承担任何任务。因此，与其冒着做出错误决定的风险，不如什么也不做。 让我们来看看查理和布伦达的例子，他们想要从他们住的小镇搬到一个更大的社区中。他们知道，这个决定会永远地改变他们生活的轨迹，他们想要确信他们做对了这件事情。他们给每个考虑搬去的城镇，列出了一长串的好处和坏处，对于某个城镇是否是适合生活、工作和养育孩子这样一个完美的地方，他们从来不会百分之百地确信。所以，他们一直没有搬迁。只要查理和布伦达推迟做出搬到哪里的决定，他们就能继续生活在这样一个幻觉中：总有一个完美方案，他们总能做出一个完美的决定。

What is the opposite of happiness? Sadness? No. Just as love and hate are two sides of the same coin, so are happiness and sadness. Crying out of happiness is a perfect illustration of this. The opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is—here’s the clincher—boredom. Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all. When people suggest you follow your “passion” or your “bliss,” I propose that they are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept: excitement.

Dreamlining is so named because it applies timelines to what most would consider dreams. It is much like goal-setting but differs in several fundamental respects: The goals shift from ambiguous wants to defined steps. The goals have to be unrealistic to be effective. It focuses on activities that will fill the vacuum created when work is removed. Living like a millionaire requires doing interesting things and not just owning enviable things.

“I believe that success can be measured in the number of uncomfortable conversations you’re willing to have. I felt that if I could help students overcome the fear of rejection with cold-calling and cold e-mail, it would serve them forever,” Ferriss said. “It’s easy to sell yourself short, but when you see classmates getting responses from people like [former president] George Bush, the CEOs of Disney, Comcast, Google, and HP, and dozens of other impossible-to-reach people, it forces you to reconsider your self-set limitations.” … Ferriss lectures to the students of “High-Tech Entrepreneurship” each semester about creating a startup and designing the ideal lifestyle. “I participate in this contest every day,” said Ferriss. “I do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if possible, often through their little-known personal blogs, send a two- to three-paragraph e-mail which explains that I am familiar with their work, and ask one simple-to-answer but thought-provoking question in that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies. The goal is to start a dialogue so they take the time to answer future e-mails—not to ask for help. That can only come after at least three or four genuine e-mail exchanges.” With “textbook execution of the Tim Ferriss Technique,” as he put it, Marrinan was able to strike up a bond with Komisar. In his initial e-mail, he talked about reading one of Komisar’s Harvard Business Review articles and feeling inspired to ask him, “When were you happiest in your life?” After Komisar replied with references to Tibetan Buddhism, Marrinan responded, “Just as words are inadequate to explain true happiness, so too are words inadequate to express my thanks.” His e-mail included his personal translation of a French poem by Taisen Deshimaru, the former European head of Soto Zen. An e-mail relationship was formed, and Komisar even e-mailed Marrinan a few days later with a link to a New York Times article on happiness.

It is efficient on some perverse level, but far from effective. Here are two truisms to keep in mind: Doing something unimportant well does not make it important. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important. From this moment forward, remember this: What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it. Efficiency is still important, but it is useless unless applied to the right things.

This served two important purposes: I learned exactly how the grader evaluated work, including his or her prejudices and pet peeves. The grader would think long and hard about ever giving me less than an A. He or she would never consider giving me a bad grade without exceptional reasons for doing so, as he or she knew I’d come a’knocking for another three-hour visit. Learn to be difficult when it counts. In school as in life, having a reputation for being assertive will help you receive preferential treatment without having to beg or fight for it every time. Think back to your days on the playground. There was always a big bully and countless victims, but there was also that one small kid who fought like hell, thrashing and swinging for the fences. He or she might not have won, but after one or two exhausting exchanges, the bully chose not to bother him or her. It was easier to find someone else. Be that kid. Doing the important and ignoring the trivial is hard because so much of the world seems to conspire to force crap upon you. Fortunately, a few simple routine changes make bothering you much more painful than leaving you in peace.

如果说我的小说里有能称作原创性的东西，它大概就产生于“自由”。在二十九岁那年，我极其单纯、毫无来由地下定决心，“我要写小说”，于是写出了第一部小说。所以我既没有欲念，也没有“所谓小说非得这么写不可”之类的制约。我对如今的文艺形势全然不知，也没有（不知算不算幸事）尊敬有加、视为楷模的作家前辈，只是想写反映当时心境的小说，仅此而已。当我感受到这种坦率而强烈的冲动时，便顾不上前因后果，趴在桌子上不管不顾地写起文章来。一言以蔽之，就是“绝不逞强”。而且写作过程非常愉快，始终有种自然的感觉：我是自由的。

厄内斯特·海明威无疑是二十世纪最有影响力的作家之一，然而其作品“以初期为佳”的观点几乎已成为世间定论。我也最喜欢他头两部长篇小说《太阳照常升起》和《永别了，武器》，以及有尼克·亚当斯登场的早期短篇小说。书中恢宏的气势让人喘不过气来。然而到了后期的作品，好固然是好的，但小说潜在的力量却有所削弱，字里行间似乎感受不到从前那种新鲜了。我揣测，这大概是因为海明威毕竟是那种从素材中汲取力量的作家。恐怕正因如此，他才主动投身战争（第一次世界大战、西班牙内战、第二次世界大战），去非洲狩猎，满世界去钓鱼，沉湎于斗牛，一直过着这样的生活。大概是经常需要外部刺激的缘故吧。这样的生活固然可以成为一种传说，但是随着年龄增长，体验赋予他的活力还是会渐渐减弱。所以（是否如此，当然只有他本人才知道），海明威虽然获得了诺贝尔文学奖（一九五四年），却沉溺于饮酒，一九六一年在声望达到顶峰之际结束了自己的生命。

她的批评，有些让我觉得“的确如此”，“说不定还真是这样”。有时候要花上几天才能达成这样的认识。也有些让我觉得“不对，岂有此理，还是我的想法才对”。不过在这样“引进第三者”的过程中，我有一条独门规则，那就是“人家有所挑剔的地方，无论如何一定要修改”。即便不能接受那种批判，但只要人家提出了意见，我就会把那个地方从头改写一遍。不同意那意见时，我甚至还往与对方的忠告完全相反的方向改写。

我敬爱的作家雷蒙德·卡佛也是一位喜欢这种“锤炼敲打”的作家。他以引用其他作家字句的形式，这样写道：“写出一则短篇小说，再仔细地重读原稿，删掉几个逗号，然后重读一遍，又把逗号放回原来的地方，这时我就知道，这则短篇小说终于大功告成了。”我十分理解这样的心情，因为同样的事情，我自己也经历过许多次。到了这一步就算极限了，再继续修改的话，说不定效果适得其反——就存在这样一个微妙的关键点。他是以逗号的删添为例，准确暗示了这个关键点。

其实刚开始写小说那阵子，我也没有什么书房，就在千谷鸠森八幡神社附近狭小的公寓里（如今已经拆除），坐在厨房的餐桌前，等家人睡下之后，深更半夜独自面对着四百字一页的稿纸奋笔疾书。就这样写出了《且听风吟》和《1973年的弹子球》这两部最初的小说。我私下里（自说自话地）把这两部作品叫作“餐桌小说”。 小说《挪威的森林》的开头部分，是在希腊各地咖啡馆的小桌上、轮渡的座椅上、机场的候机室里、公园的树荫下、廉价旅馆的写字台上写的。像四百字一页的稿纸那种体积偏大的东西，不方便随身带着四处行走，于是在罗马的文具店里买来便宜的笔记本（从前的说法叫“大学笔记簿”），用BIC圆珠笔写上蝇头小字。四周的座位吵吵嚷嚷，小桌子摇摇晃晃书写困难，笔记本又溅上了咖啡；半夜三更，正坐在旅舍写字台前推敲文字，隔着一层薄墙，隔壁的男女却声势浩大地频掀高潮。总之是历经了磨难，吃足了苦头。如今回想起来，都成了让人一笑的小插曲，可当时却着实令人沮丧。因为总也找不到固定的居所，到后来仍旧在欧洲各地游荡，在各种场所继续写这部小说。那本沾满咖啡（和莫名其妙的种种）污渍的厚厚的笔记，至今仍然留在我的手边。

说到书，我就像握着铁锨往熊熊燃烧的炭窑里乱铲乱投一般，一本又一本，如饥似渴地读过各种类型的书。单是一本本地品味和消化，每天就忙得不可开交（消化不了的更多），几乎没有多余的时间为其他事胡思乱想。有时也觉得，这样对我来说或许是好事。如果环顾自己周围的状况，认真思索那些不自然的现象、矛盾与欺瞒，直接去追究那些无法认同的事，我很可能会被逼入绝境，饱尝艰辛。 与此同时，我觉得通过涉猎各种类型的书，视野在一定程度上自然而然地“相对化”了，这对于十多岁的我也有重大的意义。就是说书中描写的种种感情，差不多都感同身受地体验了一番，在想象中自由地穿梭于时间和空间之间，目睹了种种奇妙的风景，让种种语言穿过自己的身体。因此，我的视点多少变成了复合型，并不单单立足于此刻的地点凝望世界，还能从稍稍离开一些的地方，相对客观地看看正在凝望世界的自己的模样。 假如一味从自己的观点出发凝望世间万物，世界难免会被咕嘟咕嘟地煮干。人就会身体发僵，脚步沉重，渐渐变得动弹不得。可是一旦从好几处视点眺望自己所处的立场，换句话说，一旦将自己的存在托付给别的体系，世界就会变得立体而柔软起来。人只要生活在这个世界上，这就是具有重大意义的姿态。通过阅读学到这一点，对我来说是极大的收获。

只有一点还请诸位谅解，我基本算是个“极其普通的人”。大概原来就具备几分写小说的资质（如果完全没有，也不可能如此长久地坚持写小说），然而除此之外，自己说也有点那个，我就是一个比比皆是的普通人，走在街头并不会引人注目，在餐厅里大多被领到糟糕的座位，如果没有写小说，大概不会受到别人的关注，肯定会极为普通地度过极为普通的人生。我在日常生活中几乎意识不到自己是个作家。 不过机缘巧合，偏巧身上有一点点写小说的资质，又得到幸运眷顾，再加上几分顽固（往好里说是持之以恒）性格的帮助，就这么作为一介职业小说家，一写便是三十五年有余。这个事实至今仍然令我震惊，深深地震惊。我想在这本书里表达的，就是这种震惊，就是力图将这种震惊纯粹地保持下去的强烈想法（大概称作意志也无妨）。归根结底，我这三十五年的人生，也许就是为了把这种震惊努力维持下来。我如此感觉。 最后我想说明一下：我是一个不善于单纯用大脑思考问题的人，不适合逻辑性的论述和抽象的思索。我只有通过写文章，才能按部就班地思考问题。亲自动手写文章，一次又一次地反复校读，仔仔细细地修改，才终于像常人一样把大脑里的东西整理妥当、把握透彻。正因如此，我更觉得通过经年累月写下收入本书的文章，并多次动手修改这些文章，能系统地重新思考和俯瞰身为小说家的自己，以及自己身为小说家的事实。

It is said that if everyone is your customer, then no one is your customer. If you start off aiming to sell a product to dog- or car-lovers, stop. It’s expensive to advertise to such a broad market, and you are competing with too many products and too much free information. If you focus on how to train German shepherds or a restoration product for antique Fords, on the other hand, the market and competition shrink, making it less expensive to reach your customers and easier to charge premium pricing.

“Will having a newborn distract from the time we have together?” she asked. “Don’t you think saying goodbye to your child will make your death more painful?” “Wouldn’t it be great if it did?” I said. Lucy and I both felt that life wasn’t about avoiding suffering. Years ago, it had occurred to me that Darwin and Nietzsche agreed on one thing: the defining characteristic of the organism is striving. Describing life otherwise was like painting a tiger without stripes. After so many years of living with death, I’d come to understand that the easiest death wasn’t necessarily the best. We talked it over. Our families gave their blessing. We decided to have a child. We would carry on living, instead of dying.

The tricky part of illness is that, as you go through it, your values are constantly changing. You try to figure out what matters to you, and then you keep figuring it out. It felt like someone had taken away my credit card and I was having to learn how to budget. You may decide you want to spend your time working as a neurosurgeon, but two months later, you may feel differently. Two months after that, you may want to learn to play the saxophone or devote yourself to the church. Death may be a one-time event, but living with terminal illness is a process.

Fitzgerald’s income from writing zoomed from $879 in 1919 to $18,850 in 1920, and he frittered it all away. So far as Scribner could see, Fitzgerald was not much concerned with thrift and seemed little interested in the future. He wrote Shane Leslie that Fitzgerald “is very fond of the good things of life and is disposed to enjoy it to the full while the going is good. Economy is not one of his virtues.”

Beginning with Fitzgerald, Perkins developed the habit of sending books to his laboring authors. “Max was like an old-time druggist,” remarked one of them, James Jones. “Whenever he saw you getting sluggish, he prescribed a book that he thought would pep you up. They were always specially selected for your condition, perfectly matched to your particular tastes and temperament, but with enough of a kick to get you thinking in a new direction.” In June, 1920, Max sent Fitzgerald a copy of The Ordeal of Mark Twain by Van Wyck Brooks. Brooks, Max wrote Scott, “is a brilliant chap and very attractive and if you do care for the book I would like to have you meet him at lunch some day.”

Before Perkins nobody at Scribners had edited so boldly or closely as he did Fitzgerald, and some of the older editors considered the practice questionable. They liked Max and sensed his ability, but they did not always understand him. In small ways as well as large, Max was different. He raised eyebrows, for example, by having a special desk built for himself. It was a high, broad-surfaced lecternlike affair, at which he could work standing up, his theory being that if he could not be outdoors exercising, he could at least avoid sitting down so much. People passing his office door could look in and see him at his peculiar desk, immersed in a manuscript, one leg bent at the knee and resting against the other, like a flamingo.

By summer Scott and Ernest were seeing more and more of each other, occasionally at the home of Gertrude Stein. The walls of her salon at 27 Rue de Fleurus were covered with paintings by young Picasso, Cézanne, Matisse, and other modern artists whom she sponsored before they became famous. Perkins had never met Miss Stein but he admired her novel The Making of Americans. However, he wrote Fitzgerald, he doubted if many readers would have patience with her peculiarly repetitious and impressionistic method, “effective as it does become.” Fitzgerald and Hemingway found her presence at least as commanding as her writing. They enjoyed mixing with the other literary expatriates who dropped in—among them John Dos Passos, Ford Madox Ford, Ezra Pound, and Robert McAlmon, who had published a slim book of Hemingway’s work called Three Stories and Ten Poems.

When he brought books home to put on his shelves, he immediately ripped off their dust jackets and threw them away. He instinctively closed volumes he found lying open, pages down, and he winced when he observed someone licking fingers to turn pages. He was a doodler and would ceaselessly sketch portraits of Napoleon, always in profile. He also found pleasure in dreaming up “practical” solutions to everyday problems. Among his notions were that honey ought to be packaged in transparent containers and squeezed out like toothpaste. He went so far as to suggest to a friend in advertising that they should market the product as “Tubes of Liquid Sunshine.” He also thought typewriter paper ought to come in a long, perforated roll, like bathroom tissue.

Indeed, after witnessing the bold new kind of editorial work Perkins was undertaking with Wolfe, Mrs. Boyd worked up the courage to ask Max a question that had long intrigued her. “Why don’t you write yourself?” she inquired in a letter. “I have a feeling you could write so much better than most of the people who do write.” Perkins delivered his response when they met next. She recalled, “Max just stared at me for a long time and said, ‘Because I’m an editor.’ ”

When old CS got to the office, Max told Cowley, Max explained to him that there were probably three unprintable words in the manuscript. “What are they?” Mr. Scribner asked. Perkins, who seldom used a stronger phrase than “My God,” and that only in moments of great distress, found that he simply couldn’t speak them. “Write them, then,” said Mr. Scribner. Perkins spelled out two of them on a memo pad and handed it to him. “What’s the third word?” Mr. Scribner asked. Perkins hesitated. “What’s the third word?” Scribner asked again, giving the pad back to him. Finally, Perkins wrote it, and Mr. Scribner glanced at the pad. “Max,” he said, shaking his head, “what would Hemingway think of you if he heard that you couldn’t even write that word?”

我可以具体说出下决心写小说的时刻，那是一九七八年四月一日下午一点半前后。那一天，在神宫球场的外场观众席上，我一个人一边喝着啤酒，一边观看棒球比赛。神宫球场距离我居住的公寓仅仅一步之遥，而我当时是个热情的“养乐多燕子队”支持者。天空中一丝儿云也无，风儿暖洋洋的，是个无可挑剔的阳春佳日。那时候的神宫球场外场上还没有设置坐椅，只是一面斜坡，长着一片绿草。我躺在草地上，啜饮着啤酒，不时仰面眺望天空，一边观看比赛。一如平日，观众不多。养乐多燕子队在主场迎战本赛季开幕战的对手——广岛鲤鱼队。记得养乐多燕子队的投手是安田。他是个五短身材、胖乎乎的投手，善投一手极难对付的变化球。安田第一局轻轻松松叫广岛的进攻线吃了个零蛋。接着，在第一局的后半场，第一击球手、刚从美国来的年轻的外场手迪布·希尔顿，打出了一个左线安打。球棒准确地击中了速球，清脆的声音响彻球场。希尔顿迅速跑过一垒，轻而易举地到达二垒。而我下决心道“对啦，写篇小说试试”，便是在这个瞬间。我还清晰地记得那晴朗的天空，刚刚回复了绿色的草坪的触感，以及球棒发出的悦耳声响。在那一刻，有什么东西静静地从天空飘然落下，我明白无误地接受了它。

等我们走进了房间，上了床在黑暗中做了爱，我还是感到饥饿。半夜醒来发现窗子都开着，月光照在高耸的建筑的屋顶上，这饥饿的感觉还在。我把脸从月光下转向暗处，可是睡不着，就躺着想这到底是怎么回事。我们俩在夜里醒了两次，现在月光照在她脸上，她睡得正香。 我非得把这一点想出个究竟来，可是我太笨了。那天早晨我醒来发现是个虚假的春天，听到那赶山羊群的人吹起的笛声，跑出楼去买赛马报，生活似乎显得就是那么简单。 但是巴黎是一座非常古老的城市，而我们却很年轻，这里什么都不简单，甚至贫穷、意外所得的钱财、月光、是与非以及那在月光下睡在你身边的人的呼吸，都不简单。

In 1865, nine years after Sikhdar’s computations had been confirmed, Waugh bestowed the name Mount Everest on Peak XV, in honor of Sir George Everest, his predecessor as surveyor general. As it happened, Tibetans who lived to the north of the great mountain already had a more mellifluous name for it, Jomolungma, which translates to “goddess, mother of the world,” and Nepalis who resided to the south reportedly called the peak Deva-dhunga, “Seat of God.”† But Waugh pointedly chose to ignore these native appellations (as well as official policy encouraging the retention of local or ancient names), and Everest was the name that stuck.

Following Sikhdar’s discovery in 1852, it would require the lives of twenty-four men, the efforts of fifteen expeditions, and the passage of 101 years before the summit of Everest would finally be attained.

Mallory, whose name is inextricably linked to Everest, was the driving force behind the first three expeditions to the peak. While on a lantern-slide lecture tour of the United States, it was he who so notoriously quipped “Because it is there” when an irritating newspaperman demanded to know why he wanted to climb Everest.

In 1949, after centuries of inaccessibility, Nepal opened its borders to the outside world, and a year later the new Communist regime in China closed Tibet to foreigners. Those who would climb Everest therefore shifted their attention to the south side of the peak.

To become a climber was to join a self-contained, rabidly idealistic society, largely unnoticed and surprisingly uncorrupted by the world at large. The culture of ascent was characterized by intense competition and undiluted machismo, but for the most part, its constituents were concerned with impressing only one another. Getting to the top of any given mountain was considered much less important than how one got there: prestige was earned by tackling the most unforgiving routes with minimal equipment, in the boldest style imaginable. Nobody was admired more than so-called free soloists: visionaries who ascended alone, without rope or hardware.

Maybe because I still hadn’t experienced anything of life. Least of all its many temptations and excitements. I hadn’t smoked a cigarette, hadn’t tried a drug. I hadn’t broken a rule, let alone a law. The 1960s were just under way, the age of rebellion, and I was the only person in America who hadn’t yet rebelled. I couldn’t think of one time I’d cut loose, done the unexpected. I’d never even been with a girl. If I tended to dwell on all the things I wasn’t, the reason was simple. Those were the things I knew best. I’d have found it difficult to say what or who exactly I was, or might become. Like all my friends I wanted to be successful. Unlike my friends I didn’t know what that meant. Money? Maybe. Wife? Kids? House? Sure, if I was lucky. These were the goals I was taught to aspire to, and part of me did aspire to them, instinctively. But deep down I was searching for something else, something more. I had an aching sense that our time is short, shorter than we ever know, short as a morning run, and I wanted mine to be meaningful. And purposeful. And creative. And important. Above all . . . different. I wanted to leave a mark on the world. I wanted to win. No, that’s not right. I simply didn’t want to lose. And then it happened. As my young heart began to thump, as my pink lungs expanded like the wings of a bird, as the trees turned to greenish blurs, I saw it all before me, exactly what I wanted my life to be. Play.

I was fascinated by all the great generals, from Alexander the Great to George Patton. I hated war, but I loved the warrior spirit. I hated the sword, but loved the samurai. And of all the great fighting men in history I found MacArthur the most compelling. Those Ray-Bans, that corncob pipe—the man didn’t lack for confidence. Brilliant tactician, master motivator, he also went on to head the U.S. Olympic Committee. How could I not love him? Of course, he was deeply flawed. But he knew that. You are remembered, he said, prophetically, for the rules you break.

MY NEW LOOK—castaway hair, caveman beard—was too much for my mother and sisters. I’d catch them staring, frowning. I could hear them thinking: bum. So I shaved. Afterward I stood before the little mirror on my bureau in the servants’ quarters and told myself, “It’s official. You’re back.” And yet I wasn’t. There was something about me that would never return. My mother noticed it before anyone else. Over dinner one night she gave me a long, searching look. “You seem more . . . worldly.” Worldly, I thought. Gosh.

To go out for a three-mile run was something weirdos did, presumably to burn off manic energy. Running for pleasure, running for exercise, running for endorphins, running to live better and longer—these things were unheard of. People often went out of their way to mock runners. Drivers would slow down and honk their horns. “Get a horse!” they’d yell, throwing a beer or soda at the runner’s head.

Starting my own business was the only thing that made life’s other risks—marriage, Vegas, alligator wrestling—seem like sure things. But my hope was that when I failed, if I failed, I’d fail quickly, so I’d have enough time, enough years, to implement all the hard-won lessons. I wasn’t much for setting goals, but this goal kept flashing through my mind every day, until it became my internal chant: Fail fast.

I thought my apartment was filled with shoes, but Johnson basically lived inside a running shoe. Shoved into every nook and cranny, spread across every surface, were running shoes, and more running shoes, most in some state of deconstruction. The few nooks and crannies that didn’t hold shoes were filled with books, and more books, piled on homemade bookshelves, rough planks laid on cinder blocks. And Johnson didn’t read trash. His collection was mostly thick volumes of philosophy, religion, sociology, anthropology, and the classics of Western literature. I thought I loved to read; Johnson was next level. What struck me most was the eerie violet light that suffused the whole place. Its source was a seventy-five-gallon saltwater fish tank. After clearing a place for me on the sofa, Johnson patted the tank and explained. Most newly divorced guys like to prowl singles bars, but Johnson spent his nights prowling under the Seal Beach pier, looking for rare fish. He captured them with something called a “slurp gun,” which he waved under my nose. It looked like a prototype for the first-ever vacuum cleaner. I asked how it worked. Just stick this nozzle into shallow water, he said, and suck up the fish into a plastic tube, then into a small chamber. Then shoot it into your bucket and schlep it home. He’d managed to accumulate a wide variety of exotic creatures—seahorses, opal-eye perch—which he showed me with pride. He pointed out the jewel of his collection, a baby octopus he’d named Stretch.

I’d never heard of Senter, but Sumeragi assured me the man was a genuine, head-to-toe shoe dog. I’d heard this phrase a few times. Shoe dogs were people who devoted themselves wholly to the making, selling, buying, or designing of shoes. Lifers used the phrase cheerfully to describe other lifers, men and women who had toiled so long and hard in the shoe trade, they thought and talked about nothing else. It was an all-consuming mania, a recognizable psychological disorder, to care so much about insoles and outsoles, linings and welts, rivets and vamps. But I understood. The average person takes seventy-five hundred steps a day, 274 million steps over the course of a long life, the equivalent of six times around the globe—shoe dogs, it seemed to me, simply wanted to be part of that journey. Shoes were their way of connecting with humanity. What better way of connecting, shoe dogs thought, than by refining the hinge that joins each person to the world’s surface?

Intelligence like Strasser’s, however, couldn’t be hidden for long. He was one of the greatest thinkers I ever met. Debater, negotiator, talker, seeker—his mind was always whirring, trying to understand. And to conquer. He saw life as a battle and found confirmation for this view in books. Like me, he read compulsively about war.

One of us. He knew what those words meant. We were the kind of people who simply couldn’t put up with corporate nonsense. We were the kind of people who wanted our work to be play. But meaningful play. We were trying to slay Goliath, and though Strasser was bigger than two Goliaths, at heart he was an utter David. We were trying to create a brand, I said, but also a culture. We were fighting against conformity, against boringness, against drudgery. More than a product, we were trying to sell an idea—a spirit.

Our meetings were defined by contempt, disdain, and heaps of abuse. Oh, what abuse. We called each other terrible names. We rained down verbal blows. While floating ideas, and shooting down ideas, and hashing out threats to the company, the last thing we took into account was someone’s feelings. Including mine. Especially mine. My fellow Buttfaces, my employees, called me Bucky the Bookkeeper, constantly. I never asked them to stop. I knew better. If you showed any weakness, any sentimentality, you were dead.

His ad showed a single runner on a lonely country road, surrounded by tall Douglas firs. Oregon, clearly. The copy read: “Beating the competition is relatively easy. Beating yourself is a never-ending commitment.” Everyone around me thought the ad was bold, fresh. It didn’t focus on the product, but on the spirit behind the product, which was something you never saw in the 1970s.

He had the kind of go-go motor we liked, and the credentials we always looked for. Stanford undergrad, University of Oregon Law. He also had a compelling personality, a presence. Dark, wiry, sarcastic, bespectacled, he possessed an uncommonly deep, plummy baritone, like Darth Vader with a head cold. Overall he gave the impression of a man with a plan, and the plan didn’t include surrender or sleep.

I redefined winning, expanded it beyond my original definition of not losing, of merely staying alive. That was no longer enough to sustain me, or my company. We wanted, as all great businesses do, to create, to contribute, and we dared to say so aloud. When you make something, when you improve something, when you deliver something, when you add some new thing or service to the lives of strangers, making them happier, or healthier, or safer, or better, and when you do it all crisply and efficiently, smartly, the way everything should be done but so seldom is—you’re participating more fully in the whole grand human drama. More than simply alive, you’re helping others to live more fully, and if that’s business, all right, call me a businessman.

That first meeting at Onitsuka, pleading with the executives for the right to sell Tigers . . . Can this all be a coincidence? I think of the countless Nike offices around the world.

But, by pure chance, from right to left it also spells out Pre’s best time in the mile, to the tenth of a second: 3:54.6. I say by pure chance, but is it really? Am I allowed to think that some coincidences are more than coincidental? Can I be forgiven for thinking, or hoping, that the universe, or some guiding daemon, has been nudging me, whispering to me? Or else just playing with me? Can it really be nothing but a fluke of geography that the oldest shoes ever discovered are a pair of nine-thousand-year-old sandals . . . salvaged from a cave in Oregon? Is there nothing to the fact that the sandals were discovered in 1938, the year I was born?

Athletes get lucky, poets get lucky, businesses get lucky. Hard work is critical, a good team is essential, brains and determination are invaluable, but luck may decide the outcome. Some people might not call it luck. They might call it Tao, or Logos, or Jñāna, or Dharma. Or Spirit. Or God. Put it this way. The harder you work, the better your Tao. And since no one has ever adequately defined Tao, I now try to go regularly to mass. I would tell them: Have faith in yourself, but also have faith in faith. Not faith as others define it. Faith as you define it. Faith as faith defines itself in your heart.

And somehow or other I could relax about this, and I thought to myself, I haven’t done anything important and I’m never going to do anything important.

By 1996 Hall was charging $65,000 a head to guide clients to the top of the world. By any measure this is a lot of money—it equals the mortgage on my Seattle home—and the quoted price did not include airfare to Nepal or personal equipment. No company’s fee was higher—indeed, some of his competitors charged a third as much. But thanks to Hall’s phenomenal success rate he had no trouble filling the roster for this, his eighth expedition to Everest.

In 1990, the year Hall first summitted Everest, the clinic was run by an accomplished, self-confident physician from New Zealand named Jan Arnold. Hall met her as he passed through Pheriche on his way to the mountain, and he was immediately smitten. “I asked Jan to go out with me as soon as I got down from Everest,” Hall reminisced during our first night in the village. “For our first date I proposed going to Alaska and climbing Mount McKinley together. And she said yes.” They were married two years later. In 1993 Arnold climbed to the summit of Everest with Hall; in 1994 and 1995 she traveled to Base Camp to work as the expedition doctor.

The three or four stone toilets in the village were literally overflowing with excrement. The latrines were so abhorrent that most people, Nepalese and Westerners alike, evacuated their bowels outside on the open ground, wherever the urge struck. Huge stinking piles of human feces lay everywhere; it was impossible not to walk in it. The river of snowmelt meandering through the center of the settlement was an open sewer.

The three or four stone toilets in the village were literally overflowing with excrement. The latrines were so abhorrent that most people, Nepalese and Westerners alike, evacuated their bowels outside on the open ground, wherever the urge struck. Huge stinking piles of human feces lay everywhere; it was impossible not to walk in it. The river of snowmelt meandering through the center of the settlement was an open sewer.

Rob had intended for us to spend just one day acclimatizing in Lobuje before traveling the final six or seven miles to Base Camp, which our Sherpas had reached some days earlier in order to ready the site for our arrival and begin establishing a route up the lower slopes of Everest itself.

Against the near wall was a small iron stove that supplied heat by burning dried yak dung. After sunset the temperature dropped well below freezing, and porters flocked in from the cruel night to warm themselves around the stove. Because dung burns poorly under the best of circumstances, and especially so in the oxygen-depleted air of 16,200 feet, the lodge filled with dense, acrid smoke, as if the exhaust from a diesel bus were being piped directly into the room. Twice during the night, coughing uncontrollably, I had to flee outside for air.

“The Sherpas we’ve hired are the best in the business,” he told us. “They work incredibly hard for not very much money by Western standards. I want you all to remember we would have absolutely no chance of getting to the summit of Everest without their help. I’m going to repeat that: Without the support of our Sherpas none of us has any chance of climbing the mountain.”

“His will was astonishing. It didn’t matter how much pain he was in—he would ignore it and keep going. He wasn’t the kind of guy who would turn around because he had a sore foot. “Scott had this burning ambition to be a great climber, to be one of the best in the world. I remember at the NOLS headquarters there was a crude sort of gym. Scott would go into that room and regularly work out so hard that he threw up. Regularly. One doesn’t meet many people with that kind of drive.” People were drawn to Fischer’s energy and generosity, his absence of guile, his almost childlike enthusiasm. Raw and emotional, disinclined toward introspection, he had the kind of gregarious, magnetic personality that instantly won him friends for life; hundreds of individuals—including some he’d met just once or twice—considered him a bosom buddy. He was also strikingly handsome with a bodybuilder’s physique and the chiseled features of a movie star. Among those attracted to him were not a few members of the opposite sex, and he wasn’t immune to the attention. A man of rampant appetites, Fischer smoked a lot of cannabis (although not while working) and drank more than was healthy.

together they’d agreed on one team among them who would be responsible for establishing and maintaining a route through the Icefall. For its trouble, the designated team was to be paid $2,200 from each of the other expeditions on the mountain. In recent years this cooperative approach had been met with wide, if not universal, acceptance, but it wasn’t always so. The first time one expedition thought to charge another to travel through the ice was in 1988, when a lavishly funded American team announced that any expedition that intended to follow the route they’d engineered up the Icefall would have to fork over $2,000.

   The slopes of Everest did not lack for dreamers in the spring of 1996; the credentials of many who’d come to climb the mountain were as thin as mine, or thinner. When it came time for each of us to assess our own abilities and weigh them against the formidable challenges of the world’s highest mountain, it sometimes seemed as though half the population at Base Camp was clinically delusional. But perhaps this shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Everest has always been a magnet for kooks, publicity seekers, hopeless romantics, and others with a shaky hold on reality.

As I was heading back to Base Camp through the lower Icefall, I overtook a pair of slower climbers outfitted with very strange looking clothing and equipment. It was apparent almost immediately that they weren’t very familiar with the standard tools and techniques of glacier travel. The climber in back repeatedly snagged his crampons and stumbled. Waiting for them to cross a yawning crevasse bridged by two rickety ladders spliced end to end, I was shocked to see them go across together, almost in lockstep—a needlessly dangerous act. An awkward attempt at conversation on the far side of the crevasse revealed that they were members of a Taiwanese expedition. The reputations of the Taiwanese preceded them to Everest. In the spring of 1995, the same team had traveled to Alaska to climb Mount McKinley as a shakedown for the attempt on Everest in 1996. Nine climbers reached the summit, but seven of them were caught by a storm on the descent, became disoriented, and spent a night in the open at 19,400 feet, initiating a costly, hazardous rescue by the National Park Service. Responding to a request by park rangers, Alex Lowe and Conrad Anker, two of the most skilled alpinists in the United States, interrupted their own ascent and rushed up from 14,400 feet to aid the Taiwanese climbers, who were by then barely alive. With great difficulty and considerable risk to their own lives, Lowe and Anker each dragged a helpless Taiwanese from 19,400 feet down to 17,200 feet, at which point a helicopter was able to evacuate them from the mountain. All told, five members of the Taiwanese team—two with severe frostbite and one already dead—were plucked from McKinley by chopper. “Only one guy died,” says Anker. “But if Alex and I hadn’t arrived right when we did, two others would have died, too. Earlier, we’d noticed the Taiwanese group because they looked so incompetent. It wasn’t any big surprise when they got into trouble.” The leader of the expedition, Gau Ming-Ho—a jovial freelance photographer who calls himself “Makalu,” after the striking Himalayan peak of that name—was exhausted and frostbitten and had to be assisted down the upper mountain by a pair of Alaskan guides. “As the Alaskans brought him down,” Anker reports, “Makalu was yelling ‘Victory! Victory! We made summit!’ to everyone they passed, as if the disaster hadn’t even happened. Yeah, that Makalu dude struck me as pretty weird.” When the survivors of the McKinley debacle showed up on the south side of Everest in 1996, Makalu Gau was again their leader.

At 21,000 feet, dizzy from the heat, I came upon a large object wrapped in blue plastic sheeting beside the trail. It took my altitude-impaired gray matter a minute or two to comprehend that the object was a human body. Shocked and disturbed, I stared at it for several minutes. That night when I asked Rob about it he said he wasn’t certain, but he thought the victim was a Sherpa who’d died three years earlier.

Later that day, Göran Kropp, the twenty-nine-year-old Swedish soloist, passed Camp Two on his way down to Base Camp, looking utterly worked. On October 16, 1995, he had left Stockholm on a custom-built bicycle loaded with 240 pounds of gear, intending to travel round-trip from sea level in Sweden to the top of Everest entirely under his own power, without Sherpa support or bottled oxygen. It was an exceedingly ambitious goal, but Kropp had the credentials to pull it off: he’d been on six previous Himalayan expeditions and had made solo ascents of Broad Peak, Cho Oyu, and K2. During the 8,000-mile bike ride to Kathmandu, he was robbed by Romanian schoolchildren and assaulted by a crowd in Pakistan. In Iran, an irate motorcyclist broke a baseball bat over Kropp’s (fortunately) helmeted head. He’d nevertheless arrived intact at the foot of Everest in early April with a film crew in tow, and immediately began making acclimatization trips up the lower mountain. Then, on Wednesday, May 1, he’d departed Base Camp for the top. Kropp reached his high camp at 26,000 feet on the South Col on Thursday afternoon and left for the top the following morning just after midnight. Everybody at Base Camp stayed close by their radios throughout the day, anxiously awaiting word of his progress. Helen Wilton hung a sign in our mess tent that read, “Go, Göran, Go!” For the first time in months almost no wind blasted the summit, but the snow on the upper mountain was thigh deep, making for slow, exhausting progress. Kropp bulled his way relentlessly upward through the drifts, however, and by two o’clock Thursday afternoon he’d reached 28,700 feet, just below the South Summit. But even though the top was no more than sixty minutes above, he decided to turn around, believing that he would be too tired to descend safely if he climbed any higher. “To turn around that close to the summit ….” Hall mused with a shake of his head on May 6 as Kropp plodded past Camp Two on his way down the mountain. “That showed incredibly good judgment on young Göran’s part. I’m impressed—considerably more impressed, actually, than if he’d continued climbing and made the top.” Over the previous month, Rob had lectured us repeatedly about the importance of having a predetermined turn-around time on our summit day—in our case it would probably be 1:00 P.M., or 2:00 at the very latest—and abiding by it no matter how close we were to the top. “With enough determination, any bloody idiot can get up this hill,” Hall observed. “The trick is to get back down alive.”

Relying on bottled oxygen as an aid to ascent is a practice that’s sparked acrimonious debate ever since the British first took experimental oxygen rigs to Everest in 1921. (Skeptical Sherpas promptly dubbed the unwieldy canisters “English Air.”) Initially, the foremost critic of bottled gas was George Leigh Mallory, who protested that using it was “unsporting, and therefore un-British.”

if one aspired to be considered a member of the Himalayan elite, eschewing bottled oxygen was mandatory. By 1996 some sixty men and women had reached the summit without it—five of whom didn’t make it back down alive.

The literature of Everest is rife with accounts of hallucinatory experiences attributable to hypoxia and fatigue. In 1933, the noted English climber Frank Smythe observed “two curious looking objects floating in the sky” directly above him at 27,000 feet: “[One] possessed what appeared to be squat underdeveloped wings, and the other a protuberance suggestive of a beak. They hovered motionless but seemed slowly to pulsate.” In 1980, during his solo ascent, Reinhold Messner imagined that an invisible companion was climbing beside him. Gradually, I became aware that my mind had gone haywire in a similar fashion, and I observed my own slide from reality with a blend of fascination and horror. I was so far beyond ordinary exhaustion that I experienced a queer detachment from my body, as if I were observing my descent from a few feet overhead. I imagined that I was dressed in a green cardigan and wingtips. And although the gale was generating a windchill in excess of seventy below zero Fahrenheit, I felt strangely, disturbingly warm.

Fifteen minutes of dicey, fatiguing crampon work brought me safely to the bottom of the incline, where I easily located my pack, and another ten minutes after that I was in camp myself. I lunged into my tent with my crampons still on, zipped the door tight, and sprawled across the frost-covered floor too tired to even sit upright. For the first time I had a sense of how wasted I really was: I was more exhausted than I’d ever been in my life. But I was safe. Andy was safe. The others would be coming into camp soon. We’d fucking done it. We’d climbed Everest. It had been a little sketchy there for a while, but in the end everything had turned out great.

“Both bodies were partially buried,” Hutchison recalls. “Their backpacks were maybe 100 feet away, uphill from them. Their faces and torsos were covered with snow; only their hands and feet were sticking out. The wind was just screaming across the Col.” The first body he came to turned out to be Namba, but Hutchison couldn’t discern who it was until he knelt in the gale and chipped a three-inch-thick carapace of ice from her face. Stunned, he discovered that she was still breathing. Both her gloves were gone, and her bare hands appeared to be frozen solid. Her eyes were dilated. The skin on her face was the color of white porcelain. “It was terrible,” Hutchison recalls. “I was overwhelmed. She was very near death. I didn’t know what to do.” He turned his attention to Beck, who lay twenty feet away. Beck’s head was also caked with a thick armor of frost. Balls of ice the size of grapes were matted to his hair and eyelids. After clearing the frozen detritus from Beck’s face, Hutchison discovered that the Texan was still alive, too: “Beck was mumbling something, I think, but I couldn’t tell what he was trying to say. His right glove was missing and he had terrible frostbite. I tried to get him to sit up but he couldn’t. He was as close to death as a person can be and still be breathing.” Horribly shaken, Hutchison went over to the Sherpas and asked Lhakpa’s advice. Lhakpa, an Everest veteran respected by Sherpas and sahibs alike for his mountain savvy, urged Hutchison to leave Beck and Yasuko where they lay. Even if they survived long enough to be dragged back to Camp Four, they would certainly die before they could be carried down to Base Camp, and attempting a rescue would needlessly jeopardize the lives of the other climbers on the Col, most of whom were going to have enough trouble getting themselves down safely. Hutchison decided that Lhakpa was right—there was only one choice, however difficult: let nature take its inevitable course with Beck and Yasuko, and save the group’s resources for those who could actually be helped. It was a classic act of triage. When Hutchison returned to camp he was on the verge of tears and looked like a ghost. At his urging we roused Taske and Groom and then crowded into their tent to discuss what to do about Beck and Yasuko. The conversation that ensued was anguished and halting. We avoided making eye contact. After five minutes, however, all four of us concurred: Hutchison’s decision to leave Beck and Yasuko where they lay was the proper course of action. We also debated heading down to Camp Two that afternoon, but Taske was insistent that we not descend from the Col while Hall was marooned on the South Summit. “I won’t even consider leaving without him,” he pronounced. It was a moot point, regardless: Kasischke and Groom were in such bad shape that going anywhere was out of the question for the time being. “By then I was very worried that we

Throughout April and early May, Rob Hall had expressed his concern that one or more of the less competent teams might blunder into a bad jam, compelling our group to rescue them, thereby ruining our summit bid! Now, ironically, it was Hall’s expedition that was in grave trouble, and other teams were in the position of having to come to our aid. Without rancor, three such groups—Todd Burleson’s Alpine Ascents International expedition, David Breashears’s IMAX expedition, and Mal Duff’s commercial expedition—immediately postponed their own summit plans in order to assist the stricken climbers. The day before—Friday, May 10—while we in Hall’s and Fischer’s teams were climbing from Camp Four toward the top, the Alpine Ascents International expedition headed by Burleson and Pete Athans was arriving at Camp Three. On Saturday morning, as soon as they learned of the disaster that was unfolding above, Burleson and Athans left their clients at 24,000 feet in care of their third guide, Jim Williams, and rushed up to the South Col to help. Breashears, Ed Viesturs, and the rest of the IMAX team happened to be in Camp Two at that time; Breashears immediately suspended filming in order to direct all of his expedition’s resources toward the rescue effort. First, he relayed a message to me that some spare batteries were stashed in one of the IMAX tents on the Col; by midafternoon I’d found them, allowing Hall’s team to re-establish radio contact with the lower camps. Then Breashears offered his expedition’s supply of oxygen—fifty canisters that had been laboriously carried to 26,000 feet—to the ailing climbers and would-be rescuers on the Col. Even though this threatened to put his $5.5 million film project in jeopardy, he made the crucial gas available without hesitation.

At 4:35 P.M., Burleson was standing outside the tents when he noticed someone walking slowly toward camp with a peculiar, stiff-kneed gait. “Hey, Pete,” he called to Athans. “Check this out. Somebody’s coming into camp.” The person’s bare right hand, naked to the frigid wind and grotesquely frostbitten, was outstretched in a kind of odd, frozen salute. Whoever it was reminded Athans of a mummy in a low-budget horror film. As the mummy lurched into camp, Burleson realized that it was none other than Beck Weathers, somehow risen from the dead. The previous night, huddling with Groom, Beidleman, Namba, and the other members of that group, Weathers had felt himself “growing colder and colder. I’d lost my right glove. My face was freezing. My hands were freezing. I felt myself growing really numb and then it got really hard to stay focused, and finally I just sort of slid off into oblivion.” Through the rest of the night and most of the following day, Beck lay out on the ice, exposed to the merciless wind, cataleptic and barely alive. He has no recollection of Boukreev coming for Pittman, Fox, and Madsen. Nor does he remember Hutchison finding him in the morning and chipping the ice from his face. He remained comatose for more than twelve hours. Then, late Saturday afternoon, for some unknowable reason a light went on in the reptilian core of Beck’s inanimate brain and he floated back to consciousness. “Initially I thought I was in a dream,” Weathers recalls. “When I first came to, I thought I was laying in bed. I didn’t feel cold or uncomfortable. I sort of rolled onto my side, got my eyes open, and there was my right hand staring me in the face. Then I saw how badly frozen it was, and that helped bring me around to reality. Finally I woke up enough to recognize that I was in deep shit and the cavalry wasn’t coming so I better do something about it myself.” Although Beck was blind in his right eye and able to focus his left eye within a radius of only three or four feet, he started walking directly into the wind, deducing correctly that camp lay in that direction. Had he been mistaken, he would have stumbled immediately down the Kangshung Face, the edge of which lay just thirty feet in the opposite direction. About ninety minutes later he encountered “some unnaturally smooth, bluish-looking rocks,” which turned out to be the tents of Camp Four.

In the absence of any other guides, I volunteered to fill that role and bring up the rear. As our despondent group filed slowly away from Camp Four toward the Geneva Spur, I braced myself to make one last visit to Beck, whom I assumed had died in the night. I located his tent, which had been blasted flat by the hurricane, and saw that both doors were wide open. When I peered inside, however, I was shocked to discover that Beck was still alive. He was lying on his back across the floor of the collapsed shelter, shivering convulsively. His face was hideously swollen; splotches of deep, ink-black frostbite covered his nose and cheeks. The storm had blown both sleeping bags from his body, leaving him exposed to the subzero wind, and with his frozen hands he’d been powerless to pull the bags back over himself or zip the tent closed. “Jesus fucking Christ!” he wailed when he saw me, his features twisted into a rictus of agony and desperation. “What’s a guy have to do to get a little help around here!” He’d been screaming for help for two or three hours, but the storm had smothered his cries. Beck had awakened in the middle of the night to find that “the storm had collapsed the tent and was blowing it apart. The wind was pressing the tent wall so hard against my face that I couldn’t breathe. It would let up for a second, then come slamming back down into my face and chest, knocking the wind out of me. On top of everything else, my right arm was swelling up, and I had this stupid wristwatch on, so as my arm got bigger and bigger, the watch got tighter and tighter until it was cutting off most of the blood supply to my hand. But with my hands messed up so badly, there was no way I could get the damn thing off. I yelled for help, but nobody came. It was one hell of a long night. Man, I was glad to see your face when you stuck your head inside the door.” Upon first finding Beck in the tent, I was so shocked by his hideous condition—and by the unforgivable way that we’d let him down yet again—I nearly broke into tears. “Everything’s going to be O.K.,” I lied, choking back my sobs as I pulled the sleeping bags over him, zipped the tent doors shut, and tried to re-erect the damaged shelter. “Don’t worry, pal. Everything’s under control now.” As soon as I made Beck as comfortable as possible, I got on the radio to Dr. Mackenzie at Base Camp. “Caroline!” I begged in a hysterical voice. “What should I do about Beck? He’s still alive, but I don’t think he can survive much longer. He’s in really bad shape!” “Try to remain calm, Jon,” she replied. “You need to go down with Mike and the rest of the group. Where are Pete and Todd? Ask them to look after Beck, then start down.” Frantic, I roused Athans and Burleson, who immediately rushed over to Beck’s tent with a canteen of hot tea. As I hurried out of camp to rejoin my teammates, Athans was getting ready to inject four milligrams of dexamethasone into the dying Texan’s thigh. These were praiseworthy gestures, but it was hard to imagine that they would do him much good.

Ninety minutes later, the doctors were still working on Makalu when David Breashears’s voice barked over the radio: “We’re on our way down with Beck. We’ll have him to Camp Two by dark.” A long beat passed before I realized that Breashears wasn’t talking about hauling a body off the mountain; he and his companions were bringing Beck down alive. I couldn’t believe it. When I’d left him on the South Col seven hours earlier, I was terrified that he wasn’t going to survive through the morning. Given up for dead yet again, Beck had simply refused to succumb. Later I learned from Pete Athans that shortly after he had injected Beck with dexamethasone, the Texan experienced an astonishing recovery. “Around ten-thirty we got him dressed, put his harness on, and discovered that he was actually able to stand up and walk. We were all pretty amazed.” They started descending from the Col with Athans directly in front of Beck, telling him where to place his feet. With Beck draping an arm over Athans’s shoulders and Burleson grasping the Texan’s climbing harness tightly from behind, they shuffled carefully down the mountain. “At times we had to help him pretty substantially,” says Athans, “but really, he moved surprisingly well.” At 25,000 feet, arriving above the limestone cliffs of the Yellow Band, they were met by Ed Viesturs and Robert Schauer, who efficiently lowered Beck down the steep rock. At Camp Three they were assisted by Breashears, Jim Williams, Veikka Gustafsson, and Araceli Segarra; the eight healthy climbers actually brought the severely crippled Beck down the Lhotse Face in considerably less time than my teammates and I had managed to descend earlier that morning. When I heard that Beck was on his way down, I made my way to my tent, wearily pulled on my mountaineering boots, and started plodding up to meet the rescue party, expecting to encounter them on the lower reaches of the Lhotse Face. Just twenty minutes above Camp Two, however, I was amazed to run into the entire crew. Although he was being assisted with a short-rope, Beck was moving under his own power. Breashears and company hustled him down the glacier at such a fast pace that in my own woeful state, I could barely keep up with them. Beck was placed beside Gau in the hospital tent, and the physicians began stripping off his clothing. “My God!” Dr. Kamler exclaimed when he saw Beck’s right hand. “His frostbite is even worse than Makalu’s.” Three hours later, when I crawled into my sleeping bag, the doctors were still gingerly thawing Beck’s frozen limbs in a pot of lukewarm water, working by the glow of their headlamps.

Friday evening, wandering through the alleys of Kathmandu’s Thamel district, I sought refuge from a deepening depression. I handed a scrawny Nepalese boy a fistful of rupees and received a tiny paper-covered packet in return, emblazoned with a snarling tiger. Unwrapping it back in my hotel room, I crumbled the contents across a leaf of cigarette paper. The pale green buds were sticky with resin and redolent of rotting fruit. I rolled a joint, smoked it down to nothing, rolled a second fatty, and smoked nearly half of that one, too, before the room began to spin and I stubbed it out. I lay naked across the bed and listened to the sounds of the night drift through the open window. The jingle of ricksha bells blended with car horns, the come-ons of street peddlers, a woman’s laughter, music from a nearby bar. Flat on my back, too high to move, I closed my eyes and let the glutinous premonsoon heat cover me like a balm; I felt as though I were melting into the mattress. A procession of intricately etched pinwheels and big-nosed cartoon figures floated across the backs of my eyelids in neon hues. As I turned my head to the side, my ear brushed against a wet spot; tears, I realized, were running down my face and soaking the sheets. I felt a gurgling, swelling bubble of hurt and shame roll up my spine from somewhere deep inside. Erupting out of my nose and mouth in a flood of snot, the first sob was followed by another, then another and another.

I’d always known that climbing mountains was a high-risk pursuit. I accepted that danger was an essential component of the game—without it, climbing would be little different from a hundred other trifling diversions. It was titillating to brush up against the enigma of mortality, to steal a glimpse across its forbidden frontier. Climbing was a magnificent activity, I firmly believed, not in spite of the inherent perils, but precisely because of them. Until I visited the Himalaya, however, I’d never actually seen death at close range. Hell, before I went to Everest, I’d never even been to a funeral. Mortality had remained a conveniently hypothetical concept, an idea to ponder in the abstract. Sooner or later the divestiture of such a privileged innocence was inevitable, but when it finally happened the shock was magnified by the sheer superfluity of the carnage: all told, Everest killed twelve men and women in the spring of 1996, the worst single-season death toll since climbers first set foot on the peak seventy-five years ago.

Sophomore Mark Zuckerberg arrived at his dorm room in Harvard’s Kirkland House in September 2003 dragging an eight-foot-long whiteboard, the geek’s consummate brainstorming tool. It was big and unwieldy, like some of the ideas he would diagram there. There was only one wall of the four-person suite long enough to hold it—the one in the hallway on the way to the bedrooms. Zuckerberg, a computer science major, began scribbling away. The wall became a tangle of formulas and symbols sprouting multicolored lines that wove this way and that. Zuckerberg would stand in the hall staring at it all, marker in hand, squeezing against the wall if someone needed to get by. Sometimes he would back into a bedroom doorway to get a better look. “He really loved that whiteboard,” recalls Dustin Moskovitz, one of Zuckerberg’s three suite-mates. “He always wanted to draw out his ideas, even when that didn’t necessarily make them clearer.” Lots of his ideas were for new services on the Internet. He spent endless hours writing software code, regardless of how much noncomputing classwork he might have. Sleep was never a priority. If he wasn’t at the whiteboard he was hunched over the PC at his desk in the common room, hypnotized by the screen. Beside it was a jumble of bottles and wadded-up food wrappers he hadn’t bothered to toss.

On his application for admission to Harvard two years earlier, he could barely fit all the honors and awards he’d won in high school—prizes in math, astronomy, physics, and classical languages. It also noted he was captain and most valuable player on the fencing team and could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. (His accent was awful, so he preferred ancient languages he didn’t have to speak, he told people with typical dry humor.) Harvard’s rarefied social status was neither intimidating nor unfamiliar. He’d attended the elite Phillips Exeter Academy, where you are expected to proceed to the Ivy League. He’d transferred there as a kind of lark. He’d gotten bored after two years at a public high school in Dobbs Ferry, New York, north of New York City.

Zuckerberg was by nature blunt, even sometimes brutally honest—a trait he may have acquired from his mother. Though he could be taciturn he was also the leader, simply because he so often started things. A habit of straight talk became the norm in this suite. There weren’t a lot of secrets here. The four got along in part because they knew where each stood. Rather than getting on one another’s nerves, they got into one another’s projects.

我们进了米肖餐厅，美美地吃了一餐；但是等我们吃好了，再也没有饥饿的问题了，却在乘上公共汽车回家时，那种我们在桥上感到的类似饥饿的感觉依然存在。等我们走进了房间，上了床在黑暗中做了爱，我还是感到饥饿。半夜醒来发现窗子都开着，月光照在高耸的建筑的屋顶上，这饥饿的感觉还在。我把脸从月光下转向暗处，可是睡不着，就躺着想这到底是怎么回事。我们俩在夜里醒了两次，现在月光照在她的脸上，她睡得正香。我非得把这一点想出个究竟来，可是我太笨了。那天早晨我醒来发现是个虚假的春天，听到那赶山羊群的人吹起的笛声，跑出楼去买赛马报，生活似乎显得就是那么简单。 但是巴黎是一座非常古老的城市，而我们却很年轻，这里什么都不简单，甚至贫穷、意外所得的钱财、月光、是与非以及那在月光下睡在你身边的人的呼吸，都不简单。

从那里你总是能走进卢森堡博物馆，如果你腹内空空、饿得发慌，那些名画就全都显得更加鲜明，更加清晰也更加美了。我学会更深刻地理解塞尚，真正弄明白他是怎样创作那些风景画的，正是在我饥饿的时候。我曾经时常想知道他画画的时候是否也是挨着饿的；但是我想可能他只是忘记吃饭罢了。这正是当你失眠或饥饿的时候才有的一种不健康但颇有启发性的想法。后来我想，塞尚大概是在一种不同的方面感到饥饿吧。

“你怎么这样闷闷不乐，”他说。 “不。” “是的，你是这样。你需要多出来活动活动。我顺便来看你，想邀你参加我们在那有趣的大众舞厅〔4〕举行的小型晚会，舞厅离壕沟外护墙广场很近，就在勒穆瓦纳红衣主教路上。” “在你最近这次来巴黎之前，我在那那那那儿的楼上住过两年。” “多怪啊。你肯定是这样吗？” “是的，”我说。“我肯定。舞厅的主人有一辆出租车，碰到我得乘飞机时，他总会开车送我去机场，而去机场之前我们会在舞厅的白铁皮吧台边待一会儿，摸黑喝上一杯白葡萄酒。” “我可从来就不喜欢乘飞机，”福特说。“你和你妻子准备好星期六晚上去大众舞厅吧。那儿挺愉快的。我给你画一张地图，这样你就能找到了。我是非常偶然才发现的。” “它就在勒穆瓦纳红衣主教路74号的楼下，”我说。“我当时住在三楼。” “没有门牌号码，”福特说。“可要是你能找到壕沟外护墙广场，就能找到那个地方。” 我又喝了一大口酒。侍者送来了福特要的酒，福特纠正他说，“不是白兰地加苏打水，”他提醒他，但口气很严峻。“我要的是尚贝里味美思酒加黑茶藨子酒。” “不要紧，让，”我说。“这白兰地我要了。去给先生拿他现在要的酒来。” “是我原来要的，”福特纠正道。 这时，有个面色颇为憔悴的男人披着斗篷在人行道上走过去，他偕同一个身材高挑的女人，向我们的桌子瞥了一眼，然后转过眼去，继续沿着林荫大道走去。 “你看见我不理睬他吗？”福特说。“你确实看见我没有理睬他吗？” “没有。你不理睬的是谁啊？” “贝洛克〔5〕，”福特说，“我确实给了他一个不理不睬！” “我没有看到，”我说。“你干吗要不睬他？” “有千万条充足的理由，”福特说。“可我确实给了他一个不理不睬！”

几本蓝色书脊的笔记簿、两支铅笔和一把卷笔刀（一把随身带的小折刀就显得太浪费）、大理石桌面的桌子、清晨的气息，加上地板打扫擦洗干净，再就是运气，这就是你需要的一切。为了碰上好运，你在右边口袋里放了一颗七叶树的坚果和一条兔子的小腿〔1〕。兔子腿上的毛早已给磨掉，露出的骨头和腱被磨擦得亮光光的。那些爪子在你口袋的衬里上抓挠着，于是你知道你的运气还在。 有些日子写得非常顺利，以致你可以把那片乡野写得简直能走进去再穿过林地走出来到空旷地上，然后爬上高地，观看那湖湾后边的群山。铅笔的铅芯可能会断在卷笔刀的圆锥形口中，你就得用削铅笔的小刀把它清除出来，要不然用那小刀尖利的刀刃小心地把铅笔削尖，然后回到当时，把你的手臂穿进你那背包上汗水盐渍的皮带，把背包重新提起，再把另一只臂膀伸进去，感到重量落在你的背上，开始举步走向湖边，感到软底鞋踩在松树的针叶上。 这时你会听到有人说，“嗨，海姆〔2〕，你想干什么？在咖啡馆里写作？” 你的好运就此跑掉了，你只得合上笔记簿。这是可能发生的最倒霉的事。

要克服“组合爆炸”带来的问题，就需要有能够开发目标领域结构的算法，并且要能通过启发式搜索、计划以及灵活的抽象信息处理方式有效利用已有知识，而这些都是早期人工智能系统所欠缺的地方。其早期系统性能还有一个缺陷，就是过多依赖脆弱且无根据的符号化的表达方式，再加上数据稀缺以及硬盘条件严重限制了计算机的存储容量和加工速度，这些都使早期系统没有很好的方法来控制不确定性。到了20世纪70年代中期，这些问题变得越发突出

用任何标准来衡量，我们还很穷，因此我依旧采取这样一种小小的节省开支的办法，说什么有人请我在外面吃午饭，然后花了两个钟头在卢森堡公园里散步，回到家里给我妻子描述这顿午饭是多么丰盛。当你二十五岁的时候，而且生就一副重量级拳击手的身材，少吃一顿饭能使你感到非常饥饿。但是这样也能使你所有的感官变得敏锐，我才发现我笔下的那些人物中有很多都具有极强劲的胃口并且对食物怀着极大的爱好和欲望，并且大多数都期待着能喝上一杯。

Like breaking in a baseball glove. You can’t will a baseball glove to be broken in; you have to use it. Well, you have to use a new business, too. You have to break it in. If you move on to the next thing too quickly, it will never develop its soul. Look what happens when a new restaurant opens. Everyone rushes in to see it, and it’s invariably awkward because it hasn’t yet developed soul. That takes time to emerge, and you have to work at it constantly.”

To be sure, there had been alternatives. For one thing, Maytag could have hired an out-of-town brewery to do additional brewing for him. That’s how many other microbrewers later got started, but he never even considered the possibility. It would have meant sacrificing something so fundamental as to have violated his entire purpose for getting into the business to begin with—namely, the authenticity of the products. Instead he had sweated it out, torn between the urgent pleas of his customers and his own insistence on selling only the highest quality beer he could make.

Saginaw and Weinzweig had no interest in pursuing acquisitions or moving to another location, and they knew of no alternative growth strategies for small companies like theirs. So they did a lot of reading, thinking, and talking—meeting regularly to discuss their ideas at a picnic table next to the deli. They wrote vision statements and then rewrote them, soliciting input from people inside and outside the business. By 1994, the outlines of a grand design had emerged. It was called the Zingerman’s Community of Businesses, or ZCoB, for short. Weinzweig and Saginaw envisioned a company comprised of twelve to fifteen separate businesses by 2009. The new businesses would be small and located in the Ann Arbor area. Each would bear the Zingerman’s name but would have its own specialty and identity, and all would be designed to enhance the quality of food and service offered to Zingerman’s customers while improving the financial performance of ZCoB and its components.

If he was to have any prayer of raising that much money, he’d have to write up a business plan and put together a persuasive, professional-looking presentation for potential investors. He’d have to rent a room where he could make his case. He might have to bring in some outside experts to help. Doing all that would take more of his own time and money, putting his family deeper in debt, and the odds of succeeding weren’t particularly good. If he failed, moreover, he and Krista could lose everything, including their house, and find themselves out on the street—homeless, with a two-year-old daughter, a baby on the way, no income, and a recession looming. Babinec felt that the decision had to be Krista’s. He told her that he thought he should probably start looking for a job. She could easily have said, “I think you’re right, Martin. You’ve given it your best shot, and it just hasn’t worked out. We need to get on with our lives.” In that case, he would have closed up shop and started searching the help-wanted ads. But Krista was the daughter of an entrepreneur who’d been through rough times of his own. She said, “Are you sure you want to give up now? You’ve put so much into this. You still have an option. Shouldn’t you try it?” And so he did. He immediately went to work on his business plan. He also enlisted his next door neighbor, who owned a business and had a background in accounting, to prepare and present the company’s financials. And he persuaded the guru of employee leasing, T. Joe Willey, to fly up to Oakland from San Bernardino, where he was based, and give the industry overview to the potential investors. Babinec himself would explain the new marketing strategy, and TriNet’s only employee, Helen Salamanca, would serve as emcee. On a warm evening in June 1990,

As with most addicts, Goltz had to hit rock bottom before he could summon the will to change. It happened in the spring of 1996. He had bought a building on Clybourn where he planned to create an upscale home and garden store, expanding the home store he had started in leased space down the block. The problem was that the building needed drastic renovation, and the work had to be finished in four months because he couldn’t afford to miss the spring selling season. In the midst of it all, he ran out of cash. “I went through my entire credit line,” he said. “I had nothing left. It was incredibly stressful. I couldn’t sleep at night. Our payables got longer, and we had to watch inventory like a hawk. At the same time, my mother had cancer, and my kid was having trouble in school. It was horrible. “But that was the real beginning of the change,” he went on. “It turns out there are three things you need to realize before you can get into recovery from entrepreneuraholism. First, you have to feel the pain. You need the experience of staying awake all night because you’re afraid you might lose your house. I was forty-one, out of cash, in an industry I didn’t have a handle on. I’d felt stress in the early days, when I was struggling to grow the business, but that was unavoidable. It went with the territory. This was self-imposed. I was going through it because I’d bought the building and decided to get into this business I knew nothing about. Was I out of my mind? “That led to a second realization: People who build giant companies from scratch are different from you. It’s not just brains; it’s composition. They have a stomach you don’t have. Then finally, it hits you, the third realization: Things are okay. You think, I can be happy. I can lead a good life, have a great business, make enough money, without going crazy. And you begin to notice all the unhappy rich people around, with unhappy families. When Donald Trump was asked whether he was a good father, he said, ‘I’m a good provider.’ That horrified me.

When you look closely at our small giants, one characteristic immediately jumps out at you. Like Righteous Babe, they are all so intimately connected to the place where they’re located that it’s hard to imagine them being anywhere else. Zingerman’s is almost synonymous with Ann Arbor, and Anchor Brewing is a San Francisco institution. CitiStorage is Brooklyn to the core. Reell Precision Manufacturing and the Twin Cities go together like, well, a horse and carriage. The same could be said for Clif Bar and Berkeley, ECCO and Boise, O. C. Tanner and Salt Lake City, Hammerhead and Studio City, and on and on. And the influence runs both ways. The companies shape their respective communities, and the communities shape them.

The company benefited as well from a substantial talent bank of local artists and writers, whom Fisher and DiFranco wanted to support. “Scot thought everything we did should look professional but not slick,” said Ehmke. “If that’s what you want, it makes perfect sense to hire people who haven’t done it before. I hadn’t written bios for millions of rock stars. Our designers hadn’t done a lot of record albums or music posters. Our radio guy had started out on a local college station. We were all learning as we went along.” Although new to their respective fields, they were unquestionably talented. As a result, the albums, catalogs, and marketing materials they produced were fresh and imaginative but hardly amateurish. In 2003, the music industry recognized their work by awarding DiFranco and Grunert the Grammy for best packaging.

We plant the seeds of resilience in the ways we process negative events. After spending decades studying how people deal with setbacks, psychologist Martin Seligman found that three P’s can stunt recovery:2 (1) personalization—the belief that we are at fault; (2) pervasiveness—the belief that an event will affect all areas of our life; and (3) permanence—the belief that the aftershocks of the event will last forever. The three P’s play like the flip side of the pop song “Everything Is Awesome”—“everything is awful.” The loop in your head repeats, “It’s my fault this is awful. My whole life is awful. And it’s always going to be awful.” Hundreds of studies have shown that children and adults recover more quickly when they realize that hardships aren’t entirely their fault, don’t affect every aspect of their lives, and won’t follow them everywhere forever. Recognizing that negative events aren’t personal, pervasive, or permanent makes people less likely to get depressed and better able to cope.

The three P’s play like the flip side of the pop song “Everything Is Awesome”—“everything is awful.” The loop in your head repeats, “It’s my fault this is awful. My whole life is awful. And it’s always going to be awful.” Hundreds of studies have shown that children and adults recover more quickly when they realize that hardships aren’t entirely their fault, don’t affect every aspect of their lives, and won’t follow them everywhere forever. Recognizing that negative events aren’t personal, pervasive, or permanent makes people less likely to get depressed and better able to cope.

A friend told me I had just learned something Buddhists have known since the fifth century BC. The first noble truth of Buddhism is that all life involves suffering. Aging, sickness, and loss are inevitable. And while life includes some joyful moments, despite our attempts to make them last, they too will dissolve. Buddhist teacher Pema Chödrön, who broke the Zen ceiling as the first American woman to become fully ordained in the Tibetan tradition, writes that when we accept this noble truth, it actually lessens our pain because we end up “making friends with our own demons.”19 I wasn’t going out for a drink with my demons, but as I accepted them, they did haunt me less.

Dave and I had a family ritual at dinner where we’d go around the table with our daughter and son and take turns stating our best and worst moments of the day. When it became just three of us, I added a third category. Now we each share something for which we are grateful. We also added a prayer before our meal. Holding hands and thanking God for the food we are about to eat helps remind us of our daily blessings.

We all deal with loss: jobs lost, loves lost, lives lost. The question is not whether these things will happen. They will, and we will have to face them. Resilience comes from deep within us and from support outside us. It comes from gratitude for what’s good in our lives and from leaning in to the suck. It comes from analyzing how we process grief and from simply accepting that grief. Sometimes we have less control than we think. Other times we have more. I learned that when life pulls you under, you can kick against the bottom, break the surface, and breathe again. 2 Kicking the Elephant Out of the Room IN COLLEGE, MOST people have a roommate or two.

It wasn’t until breakfast with Jeff that I realized I was sometimes the friend who avoided painful conversations. I had failed to ask him directly about his health not because I didn’t care, but because I was worried about upsetting him. Losing Dave taught me how ludicrous that was. It wasn’t possible for me to remind Jeff that he was living with MS. He was aware of that every minute of every day. Even people who have endured the worst suffering often want to talk about it. Merle Saferstein is one of my mom’s closest friends and the former education director at the Holocaust Documentation and Education Center in South Florida. She has worked with more than five hundred survivors and remembers only one who declined to open up. “In my experience, survivors want the opportunity to teach and not be shunned because they went through something unknowable,” Merle said.

Cancer is another forbidden or “whisper” topic. I read about a writer named Emily McDowell who said the worst part of being diagnosed with lymphoma wasn’t feeling sick from chemo or losing her hair. “It was the loneliness and isolation I felt when many of my close friends and family members disappeared because they didn’t know what to say, or said the absolute wrong thing without realizing it.”16 In response, Emily created “empathy cards.”17 I love them all but these two are my favorites, making me want to laugh and cry simultaneously.

“When you’re faced with tragedy,18 you usually find that you’re no longer surrounded by people—you’re surrounded by platitudes.

In classic experiments on stress,1 people performed tasks that required concentration, like solving puzzles, while being blasted at random intervals with uncomfortably loud sounds. They started sweating and their heart rates and blood pressure climbed. They struggled to focus and made mistakes. Many got so frustrated that they gave up. Searching for a way to reduce anxiety, researchers gave some of the participants an escape. If the noise became too unpleasant, they could press a button and make it stop. Sure enough, the button allowed them to stay calmer, make fewer mistakes, and show less irritation. That’s not surprising. But here’s what is: none of the participants actually pressed the button. Stopping the noise didn’t make the difference … knowing they could stop the noise did. The button gave them a sense of control and allowed them to endure the stress.

“Of course there are limits,” James acknowledged. “The trees don’t grow into the sky.” But these outer boundaries of where we will, eventually, stop improving are simply irrelevant for the vast majority of us: “The plain fact remains that men the world over possess amounts of resource, which only very exceptional individuals push to their extremes of use.” These words, written in 1907, are as true today as ever. So, why do we place such emphasis on talent? And why fixate on the extreme limits of what we might do when, in fact, most of us are at the very beginning of our journey, so far, far away from those outer bounds? And why do we assume that it is our talent, rather than our effort, that will decide where we end up in the very long run?

Lots of people nicely tried to assure me, “You will get through this,” but it was hard to believe them. What helped me more was when people said that they were in it with me. Phil Deutch did this time and again, saying, “We are going to get through this.” When he was away, he sent emails, sometimes with just one line: “You are not alone.” One of my childhood girlfriends sent a card that read, “One day she woke up and understood we are all in this together.” That card has hung above my desk ever since.

The poem relates a dream of walking on the beach with God. The storyteller observes that in the sand there are two sets of footprints except during those periods of life filled with “anguish, sorrow or defeat.” Then there is only one set of footprints. Feeling forsaken, the storyteller challenges God: “Why, when I needed you most, have you not been there for me?” The Lord replies, “The years when you have seen only one set of footprints, my child, are when I carried you.”

Decades ago, health psychologist Jamie Pennebaker had two groups of college students journal for fifteen minutes a day for just four days—some about nonemotional topics and others about the most traumatic experiences of their lives, which included rape, attempted suicide, and child abuse. After the first day of writing, the second group was less happy and had higher blood pressure. This made sense, since confronting trauma is painful. But when Pennebaker followed up six months later, the effects reversed and those who wrote about their traumas were significantly better off emotionally and physically. Since then, more than a hundred experiments have documented the therapeutic effect of journaling. It has helped medical students, patients with chronic pain, crime victims, maximum-security prisoners, and women after childbirth. It has crossed cultures and countries from Belgium to Mexico to New Zealand. Writing about traumatic events can decrease anxiety and anger, boost grades, reduce absences from work, and lessen the emotional impact of job loss. Health benefits include higher T-cell counts, better liver function, and stronger antibody responses. Even journaling for a few minutes a few times can make a difference. “You don’t have to write for the rest of your life,” Pennebaker told us. “You can start and stop when you feel you need to.” Labeling negative

Most “superheroes” are nothing of the sort. They’re weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of self-defeating habits and self-talk. Personally, I suck at efficiency (doing things quickly). To compensate and cope, here’s my 8-step process for maximizing efficacy (doing the right things): Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. Email is the mind-killer. Make a cup of tea (I like pu-erh) and sit down with a pen/pencil and paper. Write down the 3 to 5 things—and no more—that are making you the most anxious or uncomfortable. They’re often things that have been punted from one day’s to-do list to the next, to the next, to the next, and so on. Most important usually equals most uncomfortable, with some chance of rejection or conflict. For each item, ask yourself: “If this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?” “Will moving this forward make all the other to-dos unimportant or easier to knock off later?” Put another way: “What, if done, will make all of the rest easier or irrelevant?” Look only at the items you’ve answered “yes” to for at least one of these questions. Block out at 2 to 3 hours to focus on ONE of them for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important stuff slide. It will still be there tomorrow. TO BE CLEAR: Block out at 2 to 3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today. This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME. Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does not work. No phone calls or social media allowed. If you get distracted or start procrastinating, don’t freak out and downward-spiral; just gently come back to your ONE to-do.

To quote her further, from page viii: “Once we get those muddy, maddening, confusing thoughts [nebulous worries, jitters, and preoccupations] on the page, we face our day with clearer eyes.”

Dan Chambliss, the sociologist who completed the study, observed: “Superlative performance is really a confluence of dozens of small skills or activities, each one learned or stumbled upon, which have been carefully drilled into habit and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole.2 There is nothing extraordinary or superhuman in any one of those actions; only the fact that they are done consistently and correctly, and all together, produce excellence.”

Nietzsche implored us to consider exemplars to be, above all else, craftsmen: “Do not talk about giftedness, inborn talents! One can name great men of all kinds who were very little gifted.13 They acquired greatness, became ‘geniuses’ (as we put it). … They all possessed that seriousness of the efficient workman which first learns to construct the parts properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole; they allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well than in the effect of a dazzling whole.”

Grammy Award–winning musician and Oscar-nominated actor Will Smith has thought a lot about talent, effort, skill, and achievement. “I’ve never really viewed myself as particularly talented,” he once observed. “Where I excel is ridiculous, sickening work ethic.”35 Accomplishment, in Will’s eyes, is very much about going the distance. Asked to explain his ascendancy to the entertainment elite, Will said: The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is: I’m not afraid to die on a treadmill. I will not be outworked, period. You might have more talent than me, you might be smarter than me, you might be sexier than me. You might be all of those things. You got it on me in nine categories. But if we get on the treadmill together, there’s two things: You’re getting off first, or I’m going to die.36 It’s really that simple.

I would add that skill is not the same thing as achievement, either. Without effort, your talent is nothing more than your unmet potential. Without effort, your skill is nothing more than what you could have done but didn’t. With effort, talent becomes skill and, at the very same time, effort makes skill productive.

At the bottom of this hierarchy are our most concrete and specific goals—the tasks we have on our short-term to-do list: I want to get out the door today by eight a.m. I want to call my business partner back. I want to finish writing the email I started yesterday. These low-level goals exist merely as means to ends. We want to accomplish them only because they get us something else we want.

If it means I have to come to Florida and can’t get tanned because I might get a burn that would keep me from throwing for a few days, then I never go shirtless in the sun. … If it means I have to remind myself to pet dogs with my left hand or throw logs on the fire with my left hand, then I do that, too. If it means in the winter I eat cottage cheese instead of chocolate chip cookies in order to keep my weight down, then I eat cottage cheese.16 The life Seaver described sounds grim. But that’s not how Seaver saw things: “Pitching is what makes me happy. I’ve devoted my life to it. … I’ve made up my mind what I want to do. I’m happy when I pitch well so I only do things that help me be happy.”17

And then Buffett takes him through three steps. First, you write down a list of twenty-five career goals. Second, you do some soul-searching and circle the five highest-priority goals. Just five. Third, you take a good hard look at the twenty goals you didn’t circle. These you avoid at all costs. They’re what distract you; they eat away time and energy, taking your eye from the goals that matter more.

So, to Buffett’s three-step exercise in prioritizing, I would add an additional step: Ask yourself, To what extent do these goals serve a common purpose? The more they’re part of the same goal hierarchy—important because they then serve the same ultimate concern—the more focused your passion.

Notably, these also distinguished the First Ten from the Last Ten—the super-eminent from the merely eminent. Cox grouped these together and called them “persistence of motive.” Two indicators could easily be rephrased as passion items for the Grit Scale. Degree to which he works with distant objects in view (as opposed to living from hand to mouth). Active preparation for later life. Working toward a definite goal. Tendency not to abandon tasks from mere changeability. Not seeking something fresh because of novelty. Not “looking for a change.” And the other two could easily be rewritten as perseverance items for the Grit Scale. Degree of strength of will or perseverance. Quiet determination to stick to a course once decided upon. Tendency not to abandon tasks in the face of obstacles. Perseverance, tenacity, doggedness. In her summary comments, Cox concluded that “high but not the highest intelligence, combined with the greatest degree of persistence, will achieve greater eminence than the highest degree of intelligence with somewhat less persistence.”34

When I share these findings with parents and students, I hasten to add that there are many, many learning benefits to being quizzed.24 Shining a light on what you think you know but actually haven’t yet mastered is one. Indeed, winner Kerry Close later told me that she used quizzing to diagnose her weaknesses—to identify certain words or types of words she consistently misspelled so that she could focus her efforts on mastering them. In a sense, quizzing may have been a necessary prelude to doing more targeted, more efficient, deliberate practice. What about reading for fun? Nada. Pretty much all of the kids in the National Spelling Bee are interested in language, but there wasn’t even a hint of a relationship between reading for fun, which they all enjoyed, and spelling prowess.

Currently, my view is that the primary motivation for doing effortful deliberate practice is to improve your skill. You’re concentrating one hundred percent, and you’ve deliberately set the level of challenge to exceed your current level of skill. You’re in “problem solving” mode, analyzing everything you do to bring it closer to the ideal—the goal you set at the beginning of the practice session. You’re getting feedback, and a lot of that feedback is about what you’re doing wrong, and you’re using that feedback to make adjustments and try again. The motivation that predominates during flow, in contrast, is entirely different. The flow state is intrinsically pleasurable. You don’t care whether you’re improving some narrow aspect of your skill set. And though you’re concentrating one hundred percent, you’re not at all in “problem solving” mode. You’re not analyzing what you’re doing; you’re just doing. You’re getting feedback, but because the level of challenge just meets your current level of skill, that feedback is telling you that you’re doing a lot right. You feel like you’re in complete control, because you are. You’re floating. You lose track of time. No matter how fast you’re running or how intensely you’re thinking, when you’re in flow, everything feels effortless. In other words, deliberate practice is for preparation, and flow is for performance.

Which leads to my second suggestion for getting the most out of deliberate practice: Make it a habit. By this I mean, figure out when and where you’re most comfortable doing deliberate practice. Once you’ve made your selection, do deliberate practice then and there every day. Why? Because routines are a godsend when it comes to doing something hard. A mountain of research studies, including a few of my own, show that when you have a habit of practicing at the same time and in the same place every day, you hardly have to think about getting started. You just do.51

Mr. Hayman used to catch a trout or two and eat raw trout with his stone-ground wheat and his kale, and then one day he was so old that he did not feel like working any more, and he looked so old that the children thought he must be evil to live by himself, and they were afraid to go up the creek near his shack. It didn't bother Mr. Hayman. The last thing in the world he had any use for were children. Reading and writing and children were all the same, Mr. Hayman thought, and ground his wheat and tended his kale and caught a trout or two when they were in the creek.

I didn't have a net with me so I fought the trout over to the edge of the creek and swung it up onto the shore. The trout had a big red stripe down its side. It was a good rainbow. "What a beauty," he said. He picked it up and it was squirming in his hands. "Break its neck," I said. "I have a better idea," he said. "Before I kill it, let me at least soothe its approach into death. This trout needs a drink." He took the bottle of port out of his pocket, unscrewed the cap and poured a good slug into the trout's mouth. The trout went into a spasm. Its body shook very rapidly like a telescope during an earthquake. The mouth was wide open and chattering almost as if it had human teeth. He laid the trout on a white rock, head down, and some of the wine trickled out of its mouth and made a stain on the rock. The trout was lying very still now. "It died happy," he said.

Everything smelled of sheep. The dandelions were suddenly more sheep than flower, each petal reflecting wool and the sound of a bell ringing off the yellow. But the thing that smelled the most like sheep, was the very sun itself. When the sun went behind a cloud, the smell of the sheep decreased, like standing on some old guy's hearing aid, and when the sun came back again, the smell of the sheep was loud, like a clap of thunder inside a cup of coffee. That afternoon the sheep crossed the creek in front of my hook. They were so close that their shadows fell across my bait. I practically caught trout up their assholes.

The Upside of Stress: Why Stress Is Good for You, and How to Get Good at It (McGonigal, Kelly)

In the stress mindset interventions we’ve looked at so far, people were manipulated into a mindset shift. Nobody said, “Seeing the good in stress is good for you.” The message was much simpler: “Stress is good for you.” Can a mindset shift still work if you try to change your own mind about stress, or do you have to be tricked into it? One way to answer this question is to go back to the placebo effect. For a long time, doctors and scientists thought the placebo effect required deception. A sugar pill would help only if patients were convinced they were taking a real drug. But it turns out that deception is not the active ingredient in placebos. They work even when patients know they are taking a placebo. In open-label placebo trials, patients are handed a packet clearly labeled “Placebo.” The ingredients list is short: microcrystalline cellulose (sugar). The doctor tells the patient that yes, this is a placebo, and no, there is no active ingredient in it. But, the doctor explains, your mind and body are capable of many healing processes on their own, and placebos can trigger those processes. The doctor encourages the patient to take the sugar pills on a regular basis. Surprisingly, pills clearly labeled “Placebo” have provided relief from migraine headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression, often with benefits comparable to the best real treatments. Asking patients to be in on the trick—by explaining how the placebo effect works—does not reduce the placebo’s effectiveness. It may even enhance the effect. Research on mindset interventions shows that the same can be true when it comes to choosing a new mindset. When people are told how a mindset intervention works and are encouraged to remember the new mindset in everyday life, it does not decrease its effectiveness.

They were also taught a three-step process for practicing the new mindset whenever they felt stressed. The first step is to acknowledge stress when you experience it. Simply allow yourself to notice the stress, including how it affects your body. The second step is to welcome the stress by recognizing that it’s a response to something you care about. Can you connect to the positive motivation behind the stress? What is at stake here, and why does it matter to you? The third step is to make use of the energy that stress gives you, instead of wasting that energy trying to manage your stress. What can you do right now that reflects your goals and values?

Pard and his girlfriend sleep in the cabin and the baby sleeps in the basement, and we sleep outside, under the apple tree, waking at dawn to stare out across San Francisco Bay and then we go back to sleep again and wake once more, this time for a very strange thing to happen, and then we go back to sleep again after it has happened, and wake at sunrise to stare out across the bay. Afterwards we go back to sleep again and the sun rises steadily hour after hour, staying in the branches of a eucalyptus tree just a ways down the hill, keeping us cool and asleep and in the shade. At last the sun pours over the top of the tree and then we have to get up, the hot sun upon us. We go into the house and begin that two-hour yak-yak activity we call breakfast. We sit around and bring ourselves slowly back to consciousness, treating ourselves like fine pieces of china, and after we finish the last cup of the last cup of the last cup of coffee, it's time to think about lunch or go to the Goodwill in Fairfax.

I was her daughter, but more. I was Karen, Cheryl, Leif. Karen Cheryl Leif. KarenCherylLeif. Our names blurred into one in my mother’s mouth all my life. She whispered it and hollered it, hissed it and crooned it. We were her kids, her comrades, the end of her and the beginning. We took turns riding shotgun with her in the car. “Do I love you this much?” she’d ask us, holding her hands six inches apart. “No,” we’d say, with sly smiles. “Do I love you this much?” she’d ask again, and on and on and on, each time moving her hands farther apart. But she would never get there, no matter how wide she stretched her arms. The amount that she loved us was beyond her reach. It could not be quantified or contained. It was the ten thousand named things in the Tao Te Ching’s universe and then ten thousand more. Her love was full-throated and all-encompassing and unadorned. Every day she blew through her entire reserve.

we have stress responses to help us do something about it. We get stressed when our goals are on the line, so we take action. We get stressed when our values are threatened, so we defend them. We get stressed when we need courage. We get stressed so we can connect with others. We get stressed so that we will learn from our mistakes. The stress response is more than a basic survival instinct. It is built into how humans operate, how we relate to one another, and how we navigate our place in the world. When you understand this, the stress response is no longer something to be feared. It is something to be appreciated, harnessed, and even trusted.

In fact, many of the negative outcomes we associate with stress may actually be the consequence of trying to avoid it. Psychologists have found that trying to avoid stress leads to a significantly reduced sense of well-being, life satisfaction, and happiness. Avoiding stress can also be isolating. In a study of students at Doshisha University in Japan, the goal to avoid stress predicted a drop, over time, in their sense of connection and belonging. Having such a goal can even exhaust you. For example, researchers at the University of Zurich asked students about their goals, then tracked them for one month. Across two typically stressful periods—end-of-semester exams and the winter holidays—those with the strongest desire to avoid stress were the most likely to report declines in concentration, physical energy, and self-control.

When psychologist Alia Crum—the triathlete who turned housekeepers into exercisers, and who now tries to change people’s minds about stress—talks about her work to groups, she shares a story from her time as a graduate student. One night, she was working alone late in the basement of the Psychology Department at Yale, lost in a train of self-doubt, worrying about her research project and whether she would be able to finish it. There was a knock on the door. The department’s IT guy opened the door and looked in. Before Crum could say anything, he commented, “Just another cold, dark night on the side of Everest.” Then he closed the door and walked away. Two weeks later, Crum was lying awake in bed when his comment came back to her. “If you were climbing Everest, you can imagine it would be cold, and there’d be some nights it would be dark, and you’d be tired,” Crum thought. “You’d be pretty miserable. But what did you expect? You’re climbing Everest.” At that time in her life, finishing her dissertation was her Mount Everest. She wasn’t sure she would succeed. But that challenge was important enough to be worth weathering a few cold, dark nights. Everyone has an Everest. Whether it’s a climb you chose, or a circumstance you find yourself in, you’re in the middle of an important journey. Can you imagine a climber scaling the wall of ice at Everest’s Lhotse Face and saying, “This is such a hassle”? Or spending the first night in the mountain’s “death zone” and thinking, “I don’t need this stress”? The climber knows the context of his stress. It has personal meaning to him; he has chosen it. You are most liable to feel like a victim of the stress in your life when you forget the context the stress is unfolding in. “Just another cold, dark night on the side of Everest” is a way to remember the paradox of stress. The most meaningful challenges in your life will come with a few dark nights.

But the truth was, at least so far, I was consumed only with my most immediate and physical suffering. Since I’d begun hiking, the struggles of my life had only fluttered occasionally through my mind. Why, oh why, had my good mother died and how is it I could live and flourish without her? How could my family, once so close and strong, have fallen apart so swiftly and soundly in the wake of her death? What had I done when I’d squandered my marriage with Paul—the solid, sweet husband who’d loved me so steadfastly? Why had I gotten myself in a sad tangle with heroin and Joe and sex with men I hardly knew?

I cooked my dinner and retreated into my tent as soon as I could, well before dark, simply so I could be inside, even if inside only meant being surrounded by a thin sheet of nylon. Before I began hiking the PCT, I’d imagined that I’d sleep inside my tent only when it threatened to rain, that most nights I’d lay my sleeping bag on top of my tarp and sleep beneath the stars, but about this, like so much else, I’d been wrong. Each evening, I ached for the shelter of my tent, for the smallest sense that something was shielding me from the entire rest of the world, keeping me safe not from danger, but from vastness itself. I loved the dim, clammy dark of my tent, the cozy familiarity of the way I arranged my few belongings all around me each night.

Social anxiety disorder is a complex psychological condition, but one way to think of it is as a vicious cycle that traps people in social isolation. The cycle starts with anxiety about social interactions. People with social anxiety believe they are not good in social situations, so they worry about them in advance. They fear that they’ll do something foolish and that others will judge them. They panic over whether they’ll have to make small talk and be unable to escape. They might feel claustrophobic in groups and worry that they’ll get stuck in a crowd. When people with social anxiety disorder are actually in a social situation, they tend to focus on themselves instead of others. Thoughts run through their head: I look stupid. Why did I just say that? Can they tell how nervous I am? They feel awkward. They don’t know what to say. As they grow more anxious, their sweaty palms and racing heart are taken as proof of their social inadequacy: There’s something wrong with me. They start to worry that their anxiety is actually dangerous. Why am I sweating so much? Am I having a heart attack? To cope, they engage in safety behaviors, like not making eye contact, staying in the bathroom too long, looking for a way out, going home early, or getting so drunk that they can’t feel their own feet, let alone the anxiety. The self-focus and avoidance behaviors make it difficult to connect with others. So afterward, they think, “That was awful. I didn’t do well at all. I guess I can’t cope in social situations. Next time, I’ll just skip the whole thing.” It’s a vicious cycle that feeds on itself. Eventually, the anxiety about social performance becomes anxiety about anxiety. It’s a classic anxiety-avoidance cycle. Avoiding social situations becomes a strategy to avoid the anxiety—just like math anxiety can spiral into math avoidance, and my fear of flying kept me grounded and trapped.

One thing that stands out about Cotter’s students is they lack the kinds of resources that would help them easily handle situations like this. Many do not have a supportive family they can call on for help. They don’t have money in the bank. In a way, the rethinking stress mindset intervention is perfect for them. The one resource they have is themselves. They have their own courage, their own persistence, and their own motivation. Viewing stress as a sign that things were out of control, and that they were falling apart, kept them from recognizing these strengths. “Rethinking stress empowers them,” Cotter said. “It changes their beliefs about what they are capable of and what they can accomplish.”

If we focus on comforting, helping, and caring for our loved ones, we experience hope and connection. If, instead, we focus on relieving our own distress, we stay stuck in fear. The second thing this study shows is that we can create the biology of courage through small actions. In this case, it was holding a loved one’s hand while he or she experienced pain. In everyday life, there are many opportunities to make similar small choices of connection. Whether you are overwhelmed by your own stress or the suffering of others, the way to find hope is to connect, not to escape. The benefits of taking a tend-and-befriend approach go beyond helping your loved ones, although this, of course, is an important function. In any situation where you feel powerless, doing something to support others can help you sustain your motivation and optimism.

You know the feeling: There’s too much to do and not enough time to do it. Time scarcity is not just a stressful feeling; it’s a state of mind that has been shown to lead to poor decisions and unhealthy choices. In this study, the Wharton researchers tried out two different ways to relieve the feeling of not having enough time. They gave some people an unexpected windfall of free time and asked them to spend it however they wished. Others were asked to spend that time helping someone else. Afterward, the researchers asked participants to rate both how much free time they had available right now and how scarce a resource time was for them in general. Surprisingly, helping someone else decreased people’s feeling of time scarcity more than actually giving them extra time did. Those who had helped someone else reported afterward that they felt more capable, competent, and useful than people who had spent the time on themselves. This, in turn, changed how they felt about what they had to accomplish and their ability to handle the pressure.

One of the first things they found is that when people are connected to bigger-than-self goals, they feel better: more hopeful, curious, caring, grateful, inspired, and excited. In contrast, when people are operating from self-focused goals, they are more likely to feel confused, anxious, angry, envious, and lonely. The emotional consequences of these goals build up over time, so people who persistently pursue self-focused goals are more likely to become depressed, while those who pursue bigger-than-self goals show greater well-being and satisfaction with their lives.

Once again, caring created resilience. Among those who did not routinely help others, every significant stressful life event increased the risk of dying by 30 percent. But participants who went out of their way to help others showed absolutely no stress-related increased risk of death. In fact, even when they had experienced several traumatic events, they had the same risk of dying as people who experienced no major stressful life events. They seemed to be completely protected from the harmful effects of stress.

By the time you finish reading this book, you may be reconsidering some of your fundamental assumptions about success. If you’re a self-sacrificing giver, you’ll find plenty of insights for ascending from the bottom to the top of the success ladder. If you endorse giver values but act like a matcher at work, you may be pleasantly surprised by the wealth of opportunities to express your values and find meaning in helping others without compromising your own success. Instead of aiming to succeed first and give back later, you might decide that giving first is a promising path to succeeding later. And if you currently lean toward taking, you may just be tempted to shift in the giver direction, seeking to master the skills of this growing breed of people who achieve success by contributing to others.

Strong ties provide bonds, but weak ties serve as bridges: they provide more efficient access to new information. Our strong ties tend to travel in the same social circles and know about the same opportunities as we do. Weak ties are more likely to open up access to a different network, facilitating the discovery of original leads.

The takers had the lowest status. They burned bridges by constantly asking for favors but rarely reciprocating. Their colleagues saw them as selfish and punished them with a lack of respect. The givers had the highest status, outdoing the matchers and takers. The more generous they were, the more respect and prestige they earned from their colleagues. Through giving more than they got, givers signaled their unique skills, demonstrated their value, and displayed their good intentions.

Frank Lloyd Wright’s drought lasted until he gave up on independence and began to work interdependently again with talented collaborators. It wasn’t his own idea: his wife Olgivanna convinced him to start a fellowship for apprentices to help him with his work. When apprentices joined him in 1932, his productivity soared, and he was soon working on the Fallingwater house, which would be seen by many as the greatest work of architecture in modern history. Wright ran his fellowship program for a quarter century, but even then, he struggled to appreciate how much he depended on apprentices. He refused to pay apprentices, requiring them to do cooking, cleaning, and fieldwork. Wright “was a great architect,” explained his former apprentice Edgar Tafel, who worked on Fallingwater, “but he needed people like myself to make his designs work—although you couldn’t tell him that.”

studies show that on average, from sales teams to paper mill crews to restaurants, the more giving group members do, the higher the quantity and quality of their groups’ products and services. But it’s not just their groups that get rewarded: like Adam Rifkin, successful givers expand the pie in ways that benefit themselves as well as their groups. Extensive research reveals that people who give their time and knowledge regularly to help their colleagues end up earning more raises and promotions in a wide range of settings, from banks to manufacturing companies.

This is a perspective gap: when we’re not experiencing a psychologically or physically intense state, we dramatically underestimate how much it will affect us. For instance, evidence shows that physicians consistently think their patients are feeling less pain than they actually are. Without being in a state of pain themselves, physicians can’t fully realize what it’s like to be in that state.

In one experiment, they recruited ninety people to either give or receive a gift from Amazon.com. The receivers had twenty-four hours to create a wish list of ten products in the price range of twenty to thirty dollars. The senders accessed the wish lists and were randomly assigned to either choose a registry gift (from the list) or a unique gift (an idea of their own). The senders expected that the recipients would appreciate the unique gift as somewhat more thoughtful and personal. In fact, the opposite was true. The recipients reported significantly greater appreciation of the registry gifts than the unique gifts. The same patterns emerged with friends giving and receiving wedding gifts and birthday gifts. The senders preferred to give unique gifts, but the recipients actually preferred the gifts they solicited on their registries and wish lists.

Overall, when managers were randomly assigned to see employees as bloomers, employees bloomed. McNatt concludes that these interventions “can have a fairly large effect on performance.” He encourages managers to “recognize the possible power and influence in (a) having a genuine interest and belief in the potential of their employees . . . and (b) engaging in actions that support others and communicate that belief . . . increasing others’ motivation and effort and helping them achieve that potential.”

Matchers are better equipped to inspire self-fulfilling prophecies. Because they value reciprocity, when a peer or subordinate demonstrates high potential, matchers respond in kind, going out of their way to support, encourage, and develop their promising colleagues and direct reports. But the matcher’s mistake lies in waiting for signs of high potential. Since matchers tend to play it safe, they often wait to offer support until they’ve seen evidence of promise. Consequently, they miss out on opportunities to develop people who don’t show a spark of talent or high potential at first. Givers don’t wait for signs of potential. Because they tend to be trusting and optimistic about other people’s intentions, in their roles as leaders, managers, and mentors, givers are inclined to see the potential in everyone. By default, givers start by viewing people as bloomers. This is exactly what has enabled C. J. Skender to develop so many star students. He isn’t unusual in recognizing talented people; he simply starts by seeing everyone as talented and tries to bring out the best in them. In Skender’s mind, every student who walks into his classroom is a diamond in the rough—able and willing to be mined, cut, and polished.

Economists explain this behavior using a concept known as the “sunk cost fallacy”: when estimating the value of a future investment, we have trouble ignoring what we’ve already invested in the past. Sunk costs are part of the story, but new research shows that other factors matter more. To figure out why and when escalation of commitment happens, researchers at Michigan State University analyzed 166 different studies. Sunk costs do have a small effect—decision makers are biased in favor of their previous investments—but three other factors are more powerful. One is anticipated regret: will I be sorry that I didn’t give this another chance? The second is project completion: if I keep investing, I can finish the project. But the single most powerful factor is ego threat: if I don’t keep investing, I’ll look and feel like a fool. In response to ego threat, people invest more, hoping to turn the project into a success so they can prove to others—and themselves—that they were right all along.

When our audiences are skeptical, the more we try to dominate them, the more they resist. Even with a receptive audience, dominance is a zero-sum game: the more power and authority I have, the less you have. When takers come across someone more dominant, they’re at risk of losing their influence. Conversely, prestige isn’t zero-sum; there’s no limit to the amount of respect and admiration that we can dole out. This means that prestige usually has more lasting value, and it’s worth examining how people earn it.

THE phrase Daring Greatly is from Theodore Roosevelt’s speech “Citizenship in a Republic.” The speech, sometimes referred to as “The Man in the Arena,” was delivered at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, on April 23, 1910. This is the passage that made the speech famous: “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.…” The first time I read this quote, I thought, This is vulnerability. Everything I’ve learned from over a decade of research on vulnerability has taught me this exact lesson. Vulnerability is not knowing victory or defeat, it’s understanding the necessity of both; it’s engaging. It’s being all in. Vulnerability is not weakness, and the uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure we face every day are not optional. Our only choice is a question of engagement. Our willingness to own and engage with our vulnerability determines the depth of our courage and the clarity of our purpose; the level to which we protect ourselves from being vulnerable is a measure of our fear and disconnection. When we spend our lives waiting until we’re perfect or bulletproof before we walk into the arena, we ultimately sacrifice relationships and opportunities that may not be recoverable, we squander our precious time, and we turn our backs on our gifts, those unique contributions that only we can make. Perfect and bulletproof are seductive, but they don’t exist in the human experience. We must walk into the arena, whatever it may be—a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation—with courage and the willingness to engage. Rather than sitting on the sidelines and hurling judgment and advice, we must dare to show up and let ourselves be seen. This is vulnerability. This is daring greatly.

In her book The Soul of Money, she refers to scarcity as “the great lie.” She writes: For me, and for many of us, our first waking thought of the day is “I didn’t get enough sleep.” The next one is “I don’t have enough time.” Whether true or not, that thought of not enough occurs to us automatically before we even think to question or examine it. We spend most of the hours and the days of our lives hearing, explaining, complaining, or worrying about what we don’t have enough of.…Before we even sit up in bed, before our feet touch the floor, we’re already inadequate, already behind, already losing, already lacking something. And by the time we go to bed at night, our minds are racing with a litany of what we didn’t get, or didn’t get done, that day. We go to sleep burdened by those thoughts and wake up to that reverie of lack.…This internal condition of scarcity, this mind-set of scarcity, lives at the very heart of our jealousies, our greed, our prejudice, and our arguments with life.…(43–45).

The counterapproach to living in scarcity is not about abundance. In fact, I think abundance and scarcity are two sides of the same coin. The opposite of “never enough” isn’t abundance or “more than you could ever imagine.” The opposite of scarcity is enough, or what I call Wholeheartedness. As I explained in the Introduction, there are many tenets of Wholeheartedness, but at its very core is vulnerability and worthiness: facing uncertainty, exposure, and emotional risks, and knowing that I am enough.

When we apologize for something we’ve done, make amends, or change a behavior that doesn’t align with our values, guilt—not shame—is most often the driving force.

We live in a world where most people still subscribe to the belief that shame is a good tool for keeping people in line. Not only is this wrong, but it’s dangerous. Shame is highly correlated with addiction, violence, aggression, depression, eating disorders, and bullying. Researchers don’t find shame correlated with positive outcomes at all—there are no data to support that shame is a helpful compass for good behavior. In fact, shame is much more likely to be the cause of destructive and hurtful behaviors than it is to be the solution.

Here are the four elements of shame resilience—the steps don’t always happen in this order, but they always ultimately lead us to empathy and healing: Recognizing Shame and Understanding Its Triggers. Shame is biology and biography. Can you physically recognize when you’re in the grips of shame, feel your way through it, and figure out what messages and expectations triggered it? Practicing Critical Awareness. Can you reality-check the messages and expectations that are driving your shame? Are they realistic? Attainable? Are they what you want to be or what you think others need/want from you? Reaching Out. Are you owning and sharing your story? We can’t experience empathy if we’re not connecting. Speaking Shame. Are you talking about how you feel and asking for what you need when you feel shame?

Practice courage and reach out! Yes, I want to hide, but the way to fight shame and to honor who we are is by sharing our experience with someone who has earned the right to hear it—someone who loves us, not despite our vulnerabilities, but because of them. Talk to myself the way I would talk to someone I really love and whom I’m trying to comfort in the midst of a meltdown: You’re okay. You’re human—we all make mistakes. I’ve got your back. Normally during a shame attack we talk to ourselves in ways we would NEVER talk to people we love and respect. Own the story! Don’t bury it and let it fester or define me. I often say this aloud: “If you own this story you get to write the ending. If you own this story you get to write the ending.” When we bury the story we forever stay the subject of the story. If we own the story we get to narrate the ending. As Carl Jung said, “I am not what has happened to me. I am what I choose to become.”

“You’re only as sick as your secrets.” In a pioneering study, psychologist and University of Texas professor James Pennebaker and his colleagues studied what happened when trauma survivors—specifically rape and incest survivors—kept their experiences secret. The research team found that the act of not discussing a traumatic event or confiding it to another person could be more damaging than the actual event. Conversely, when people shared their stories and experiences, their physical health improved, their doctor’s visits decreased, and they showed significant decreases in their stress hormones.

As scarcity has grabbed hold of our culture, it’s not just “Don’t be perceived as weak,” but also “You better be great and all powerful.” This image first came to mind when I interviewed a man who was in deep shame about getting “downsized.” He told me, “It’s funny. My father knows. My two closest friends know. But my wife doesn’t know. It’s been six months, and every morning I still get dressed and leave the house like I’m going to work. I drive across town, sit in coffee shops, and look for a job.” I’m a skilled interviewer, but I can imagine that the look on my face conveyed something like “How on earth did you pull that off?” Without waiting for my next question, he answered, “She doesn’t want to know. If she already knows, she wants me to keep pretending. Trust me, if I find another job and tell her after I’m back at work, she’ll be grateful. Knowing would change the way she feels about me. She didn’t sign up for this.”

Here’s the painful pattern that emerged from my research with men: We ask them to be vulnerable, we beg them to let us in, and we plead with them to tell us when they’re afraid, but the truth is that most women can’t stomach it. In those moments when real vulnerability happens in men, most of us recoil with fear and that fear manifests as everything from disappointment to disgust. And men are very smart. They know the risks, and they see the look in our eyes when we’re thinking, C’mon! Pull it together. Man up. As Joe Reynolds, one of my mentors and the dean at our church, once told me during a conversation about men, shame, and vulnerability, “Men know what women really want. They want us to pretend to be vulnerable. We get really good at pretending.”

He said, “For five bucks and five minutes, you think you’re getting what you need, and you don’t have to risk rejection.” The reason that response was so revelatory to me was because it was so utterly different from what women felt. After interviewing women for a decade, it was clear that women see the issue of men and pornography as having to do with their own inadequate appearance and/or their lack of sexual expertise. At the end of my interview with this wonderful and wise man, he said, “I guess the secret is that sex is terrifying for most men. That’s why you see everything from porn to the violent, desperate attempts to exercise power and control. Rejection is deeply painful.”

Women, who feel shame when they don’t feel heard or validated, often resort to pushing and provoking with criticism (“Why don’t you ever do enough?” or “You never get it right”). Men, in turn, who feel shame when they feel criticized for being inadequate, either shut down (leading women to poke and provoke more) or come back with anger.

“Real isn’t how you are made,” said the Skin Horse. “It’s a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but really loves you, then you become Real.” “Does it hurt?” asked the Rabbit. “Sometimes,” said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. “When you are Real, you don’t mind being hurt.” “Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,” he asked, “or bit by bit?” “It doesn’t happen all at once,” said the Skin Horse. “You become. It takes a long time. That’s why it doesn’t often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out, and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are Real, you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.”

In a classic experiment led by the psychologist Elliot Aronson, students listened to one of four tapes of a candidate auditioning for a Quiz Bowl team. Half of the time, the candidate was an expert, getting 92 percent of questions right. The other half of the time, the candidate had only average knowledge, getting 30 percent right. As expected, audiences favored the expert. But an interesting wrinkle emerged when the tape included a clumsy behavior by the candidate. Dishes crashed, and the candidate said, “Oh, my goodness—I’ve spilled coffee all over my new suit.” When the average candidate was clumsy, audiences liked him even less. But when the expert was clumsy, audiences liked him even more. Psychologists call this the pratfall effect. Spilling a cup of coffee hurt the image of the average candidate: it was just another reason for the audience to dislike him. But the same blunder helped the expert appear human and approachable—instead of superior and distant.*

Asking questions opened the door for customers to experience what the psychologist James Pennebaker calls the joy of talking. Years ago, Pennebaker divided strangers into small groups. Imagine that you’ve just joined one of his groups, and you have fifteen minutes to talk with strangers about a topic of your choice. You might chat about your hometown, where you went to college, or your career. After the fifteen minutes are up, you rate how much you like the group. It turns out that the more you talked, the more you like the group. This isn’t surprising, since people love to talk about themselves. But let me ask you another question: How much did you learn about the group? Logically, learning about the people around you should depend on listening. The less you talk, the more you should discover about the group. But Pennebaker found the opposite: the more you talk, the more you think you’ve learned about the group. By talking like a taker and dominating the conversation, you believe you’ve actually come to know the people around you, even though they barely spoke. In Opening Up, Pennebaker muses, “Most of us find that communicating our thoughts is a supremely enjoyable learning experience.” It’s the givers,

The three forms of shielding that I am about to introduce are what I refer to as the “common vulnerability arsenal” because I have found that we all incorporate them into our personal armor in some way. These include foreboding joy, or the paradoxical dread that clamps down on momentary joyfulness; perfectionism, or believing that doing everything perfectly means you’ll never feel shame; and numbing, the embrace of whatever deadens the pain of discomfort and pain. Each shield is followed by “Daring Greatly” strategies, all variants on “being enough” that have proved to be effective at disarming the three common forms of shielding.

A man in his early sixties told me, “I used to think the best way to go through life was to expect the worst. That way, if it happened, you were prepared, and if it didn’t happen, you were pleasantly surprised. Then I was in a car accident and my wife was killed. Needless to say, expecting the worst didn’t prepare me at all. And worse, I still grieve for all of those wonderful moments we shared and that I didn’t fully enjoy. My commitment to her is to fully enjoy every moment now. I just wish she was here, now that I know how to do that.”

Scarcity and fear drive foreboding joy. We’re afraid that the feeling of joy won’t last, or that there won’t be enough, or that the transition to disappointment (or whatever is in store for us next) will be too difficult. We’ve learned that giving in to joy is, at best, setting ourselves up for disappointment and, at worst, inviting disaster. And we struggle with the worthiness issue. Do we deserve our joy, given our inadequacies and imperfections? What about the starving children and the war-ravaged world? Who are we to be joyful? If the opposite of scarcity is enough, then practicing gratitude is how we acknowledge that there’s enough and that we’re enough. I use the word practicing because the research participants spoke of tangible gratitude practices, more than merely having an attitude of gratitude or feeling grateful. In fact, they gave specific examples of gratitude practices that included everything from keeping gratitude journals and gratitude jars to implementing family gratitude rituals.

Perfectionism is not self-improvement. Perfectionism is, at its core, about trying to earn approval. Most perfectionists grew up being praised for achievement and performance (grades, manners, rule following, people pleasing, appearance, sports). Somewhere along the way, they adopted this dangerous and debilitating belief system: “I am what I accomplish and how well I accomplish it. Please. Perform. Perfect.” Healthy striving is self- focused: How can I improve? Perfectionism is other-focused: What will they think?

Perfectionism is not the key to success. In fact, research shows that perfectionism hampers achievement. Perfectionism is correlated with depression, anxiety, addiction, and life paralysis or missed opportunities. The fear of failing, making mistakes, not meeting people’s expectations, and being criticized keeps us outside of the arena where healthy competition and striving unfolds. Last, perfectionism is not a way to avoid shame. Perfectionism is a form of shame. Where we struggle with perfectionism, we struggle with shame.

Perfectionism is addictive, because when we invariably do experience shame, judgment, and blame, we often believe it’s because we weren’t perfect enough. Rather than questioning the faulty logic of perfectionism, we become even more entrenched in our quest to look and do everything just right. Perfectionism actually sets us up to feel shame, judgment, and blame, which then leads to even more shame and self-blame: “It’s my fault. I’m feeling this way because I’m not good enough.”

I remind myself, “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” (Cribbed from Voltaire.) A twenty-minute walk that I do is better than the four-mile run that I don’t do.

Belonging: Belonging is the innate human desire to be part of something larger than us. Because this yearning is so primal, we often try to acquire it by fitting in and by seeking approval, which are not only hollow substitutes for belonging, but often barriers to it. Because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic, imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance.

When we treat people as objects, we dehumanize them. We do something really terrible to their souls and to our own. Martin Buber, an Austrian-born philosopher, wrote about the differences between an I-it relationship and an I-you relationship. An I-it relationship is basically what we create when we are in transactions with people whom we treat like objects—people who are simply there to serve us or complete a task. I-you relationships are characterized by human connection and empathy. Buber wrote, “When two people relate to each other authentically and humanly, God is the electricity that surges between them.” After spending a decade studying belonging, authenticity, and shame, I can say for certain that we are hardwired for connection—emotionally, physically, and spiritually. I’m not suggesting that we engage in a deep, meaningful relationship with the man who works at the cleaners or the woman who works at the drive-through, but I am suggesting that we stop dehumanizing people and start looking them in the eye when we speak to them.

You can chat on message boards for half an hour and be energized by community and ready to go back to work, or you can chat on message boards because you’re avoiding talking to your partner about how angry he or she made you last night.” I found that what emerged from the data was exactly what Louden points out: “It’s not what you do; it’s why you do it that makes the difference.” The invitation is to think about the intention behind our choices and, if helpful, to discuss these issues with family, close friends, or a helping professional. There aren’t any checklists or norms to help you identify shadow comforts or other destructive numbing behavior. This requires self-examination and reflection. Additionally, I would recommend listening with great care if the people you love say that they are concerned about you engaging in these types of behaviors. But ultimately these are questions that transcend what we know and how we feel—they’re about our spirit. Are my choices comforting and nourishing my spirit, or are they temporary reprieves from vulnerability and difficult emotions ultimately diminishing my spirit? Are my choices leading to my Wholeheartedness, or do they leave me feeling empty and searching?

The answer to the question of whether to use soft positional bargaining or hard is “neither.” Change the game. At the Harvard Negotiation Project we have been developing an alternative to positional bargaining: a method of negotiation explicitly designed to produce wise outcomes efficiently and amicably. This method, called principled negotiation or negotiation on the merits, can be boiled down to four basic points. These four points define a straightforward method of negotiation that can be used under almost any circumstance. Each point deals with a basic element of negotiation, and suggests what you should do about it.

Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process. If they are not involved in the process, they are hardly likely to approve the product. It is that simple. If you go to the state insurance commissioner prepared for battle after a long investigation, it is not surprising that he is going to feel threatened and resist your conclusions. If you fail to ask an employee whether he wants an assignment with responsibility, don’t be surprised to find out that he resents it. If you want the other side to accept a disagreeable conclusion, it is crucial that you involve them in the process of reaching that conclusion. This is precisely what people tend not to do. When you have a difficult issue to handle, your instinct is to leave the hard part until last. “Let’s be sure we have the whole thing worked out before we approach the Commissioner.” The Commissioner, however, is much more likely to agree to a revision of the regulations if he feels that he has had a part in drafting it. This way the revision becomes just one more small step in the long drafting process that produced his original regulation rather than someone’s attempt to butcher his completed product.

To involve the other side, get them involved early. Ask their advice. Giving credit generously for ideas wherever possible will give them a personal stake in defending those ideas to others. It may be hard to resist the temptation to take credit for yourself, but forbearance pays off handsomely. Apart from the substantive merits, the feeling of participation in the process is perhaps the single most important factor in determining whether a negotiator accepts a proposal. In a sense, the process is the product.

What can be done about these three problems of communication? Listen actively and acknowledge what is being said. The need for listening is obvious, yet it is difficult to listen well, especially under the stress of an ongoing negotiation. Listening enables you to understand their perceptions, feel their emotions, and hear what they are trying to say. Active listening improves not only what you hear, but also what they say. If you pay attention and interrupt occasionally to say, “Did I understand correctly that you are saying that ... ?” the other side will realize that they are not just killing time, not just going through a routine. They will also feel the satisfaction of being heard and understood. It has been said that the cheapest concession you can make to the other side is to let them know they have been heard. Standard techniques of good listening are to pay close attention to what is said, to ask the other party to spell out carefully and clearly exactly what they mean, and to request that ideas be repeated if there is any ambiguity or uncertainty. Make it your task while listening not to phrase a response, but to understand them as they see themselves. Take in their perceptions, their needs, and their constraints.

Speak about yourself, not about them. In many negotiations, each side explains and condemns at great length the motivations and intentions of the other side. It is more persuasive, however, to describe a problem in terms of its impact on you than in terms of what they did or why: “I feel let down” instead of “You broke your word.” “We feel discriminated against” rather than “You’re a racist.” If you make a statement about them that they believe is untrue, they will ignore you or get angry; they will not focus on your concern. But a statement about how you feel is difficult to challenge. You convey the same information without provoking a defensive reaction that will prevent them from taking it in.

Build a working relationship. Knowing the other side personally really does help. It is much easier to attribute diabolical intentions to an unknown abstraction called the “other side” than to someone you know personally. Dealing with a classmate, a colleague, a friend, or even a friend of a friend is quite different from dealing with a stranger. The more quickly you can turn a stranger into someone you know, the easier a negotiation is likely to become. You have less difficulty understanding where they are coming from. You have a foundation of trust to build upon in a difficult negotiation. You have smooth, familiar communication routines. It is easier to defuse tension with a joke or an informal aside. The time to develop such a relationship is before the negotiation begins. Get to know them and find out about their likes and dislikes. Find ways to meet them informally. Try arriving early to chat before the negotiation is scheduled to start, and linger after it ends. Benjamin Franklin’s favorite technique was to ask an adversary if he could borrow a certain book. This would flatter the person and give him the comfortable feeling of knowing

Of course, there’s a time and a place for leaders to use powerful speech. In a study of pizza franchises, colleagues Francesca Gino, Dave Hofmann, and I found that when most employees in a store are dutiful followers, managers are well served to speak powerfully. But when most employees are proactive, generating new ideas for cooking and delivering pizzas more efficiently, powerful speech backfires. When employees were proactive, managers who talked forcefully led their stores to 14 percent lower profits than managers who talked less assertively and more tentatively. By conveying dominance, the powerful speakers discouraged their proactive employees from contributing. When people use powerful communication, others perceive them as “preferring and pursuing individual accomplishments,” Fragale writes, “at the expense of group accomplishments.” Through talking tentatively, the powerless speakers earned prestige: they showed openness to proactive ideas that would benefit the group.

Takers assume that the best path to a board seat is ingratiation. They flatter a director with compliments, or track down his friends to praise him indirectly. Yet Stern and Westphal found that flattery only worked when it was coupled with advice seeking. Instead of just complimenting a director, executives who got board seats were more likely to seek advice along with the compliment. When praising a director’s skill, the advice-seeking executives asked how she mastered it. When extolling a director’s success in a task, these executives asked for recommendations about how to replicate his success. When executives asked a director for advice in this manner, that director was significantly more likely to recommend them for a board appointment—and they landed more board seats as a result. Advice seeking is a form of powerless communication that combines expressing vulnerability, asking questions, and talking tentatively. When we ask others for advice, we’re posing a question that conveys uncertainty and makes us vulnerable. Instead of confidently projecting that we have all the answers, we’re admitting that others might have superior knowledge. As a result, takers and matchers tend to shy away from advice seeking. From a taker’s perspective, asking for advice means acknowledging that you don’t have all the answers. Takers may fear that seeking advice might make them look weak, dependent, or incompetent. They’re wrong: research shows that people who regularly seek advice and help from knowledgeable colleagues are actually rated more favorably by supervisors than those who never seek advice and help.

As Benjamin Franklin wrote in his autobiography, “He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged.” When we ask people for advice, we grant them prestige, showing that we respect and admire their insights and expertise. Since most people are matchers, they tend to respond favorably and feel motivated to support us in return. When Annie approached the human resources manager for advice, the manager stepped up and went to bat for her. According to biographer Walter Isaacson, Benjamin Franklin saw advice seeking as a form of flattery. Franklin “had a fundamental rule for winning friends,” Isaacson writes: appeal to “their pride and vanity by constantly seeking their opinion and advice, and they will admire you for your judgment and wisdom.”

Most people assume that self-interest and other-interest are opposite ends of one continuum. Yet in my studies of what drives people at work, I’ve consistently found that self-interest and other-interest are completely independent motivations: you can have both of them at the same time. As Bill Gates argued at the World Economic Forum, “there are two great forces of human nature: self-interest, and caring for others,” and people are most successful when they are driven by a “hybrid engine” of the two. If takers are selfish and failed givers are selfless, successful givers are otherish: they care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitious goals for advancing their own interests.

In research with two colleagues, I’ve discovered that the perception of impact serves as a buffer against stress, enabling employees to avoid burnout and maintain their motivation and performance. In one study, a student and I found that high school teachers who perceived their jobs as stressful and demanding reported significantly greater burnout. But upon closer inspection, job stress was only linked to higher burnout for teachers who felt they didn’t make a difference. A sense of lasting impact protected against stress, preventing exhaustion.

In this study, led by the psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky, people performed five random acts of kindness every week for six weeks. They were randomly divided into two groups: half chunked their giving into a single day each week, and the other half sprinkled it across all five days each week. At the end of the six weeks, despite performing the same number of helping acts, only one group felt significantly happier. The chunkers achieved gains in happiness; the sprinklers didn’t. Happiness increased when people performed all five giving acts in a single day, rather than doing one a day.

Chunking giving is an otherish strategy. Instead of mentoring students after school, when she was already exhausted, Conrey reserved it for the weekend, when her energy was recharged and it was more convenient in her schedule. In contrast, selfless givers are more inclined to sprinkle their giving throughout their days, helping whenever people need them. This can become highly distracting and exhausting, robbing selfless givers of the attention and energy necessary to complete their own work.

One hundred seems to be a magic number when it comes to giving.

In another study, American adults who volunteered at least one hundred hours in 1998 were more likely to be alive in 2000. There were no benefits of volunteering more than one hundred hours. This is the 100-hour rule of volunteering. It appears to be the range where giving is maximally energizing and minimally draining.

Although Conrey’s decision to ask another teacher for help may not sound unusual, research shows that it’s quite rare among selfless givers. Selfless givers “feel uncomfortable receiving support,” write Helgeson and colleague Heidi Fritz. Selfless givers are determined to be in the helper role, so they’re reluctant to burden or inconvenience others. Helgeson and Fritz find that selfless givers receive far less support than otherish givers, which proves psychologically and physically costly. As burnout expert Christina Maslach and colleagues conclude, “there is now a consistent and strong body of evidence that a lack of social support is linked to burnout.” In contrast, otherish givers recognize the importance of protecting their own well-being. When they’re on the brink of burnout, otherish givers seek help, which enables them to marshal the advice, assistance, and resources necessary to maintain their motivation and energy. Three decades of research show that receiving support from colleagues is a robust antidote to burnout. “Having a support network of teachers is huge,” Conrey affirms.

UCLA psychologist Shelley Taylor has discovered a stress response that differs from fight or flight. She calls it tend and befriend. “One of the most striking aspects of the human stress response is the tendency to affiliate—that is, to come together in groups to provide and receive joint protection in threatening times.” Taylor’s neuroscience research reveals that when we feel stressed, the brain’s natural response is to release chemicals that drive us to bond.

Given what I’ve learned from the research, and what I’ve observed over the past couple of years as I’ve worked with leaders from schools and companies of all sizes and types, I believe we have to completely reexamine the idea of engagement. I call it disruptive engagement for this reason. To reignite creativity, innovation, and learning, leaders must rehumanize education and work. This means understanding how scarcity is affecting the way we lead and work, learning how to engage with vulnerability, and recognizing and combating shame.

I believe that feedback thrives in cultures where the goal is not “getting comfortable with hard conversations” but normalizing discomfort. If leaders expect real learning, critical thinking, and change, then discomfort should be normalized: “We believe growth and learning are uncomfortable so it’s going to happen here—you’re going to feel that way. We want you to know that it’s normal and it’s an expectation here. You’re not alone and we ask that you stay open and lean into it.” This is true at all levels and in all organizations, schools, faith communities, and even families.

During the Q&A session after my talk, one of the students asked me a question that I’m sure is often on the minds of people when I talk about vulnerability. He said, “I can see how vulnerability is important, but I’m in sales and I don’t get what that looks like. Does being vulnerable mean that if a customer asks me a question about a product and I don’t know the answer, I just say what I’m thinking: ‘I’m new and I really don’t know what I’m doing?’” The students, who were all turned around listening to him, turned back in their chairs and looked at me as if to say, “Yeah, that seems lame. Are we really supposed to do that?” My answer was no. And yes. In that scenario vulnerability is recognizing and owning that you don’t know something; it’s looking the customer in the eye and saying, “I don’t know the answer to that, but I’ll find out. I want to make sure you have the correct information.” I explained that the unwillingness to engage with the vulnerability of not knowing often leads to making excuses, dodging the question, or—worst-case scenario—bullshitting. That’s the deathblow in any relationship, and the one thing I’ve learned from talking to people who sell for a living is that sales is all about relationships.

“When you shut down vulnerability, you shut down opportunity.” Here’s how she explained it: “By definition, entrepreneurship is vulnerable. It’s all about the ability to handle and manage uncertainty. People are constantly changing, budgets change, boards change, and competition means you have to stay nimble and innovative. You have to create a vision and live up to that vision. There is no vision without vulnerability.” Knowing that Gay spends a considerable amount of time teaching and mentoring, I asked her what advice she gives new entrepreneurs about embracing uncertainty. She said, “Success requires entrepreneurs to cultivate strong support networks and good mentors. You need to learn how to shut out the noise so you can get clear on how you feel and what you think, and then you do the hard work. No question—it’s all about vulnerability.”

This scarcity makes leadership valuable.…It’s uncomfortable to stand up in front of strangers. It’s uncomfortable to propose an idea that might fail. It’s uncomfortable to challenge the status quo. It’s uncomfortable to resist the urge to settle. When you identify the discomfort, you’ve found the place where a leader is needed.

Although Lillian Bauer and Jason Geller are both givers, they found themselves on very different trajectories. Why did giving stall her career, while accelerating his? The intuitive answer has to do with gender, but that’s not the key differentiator—at least not in the conventional sense. Lillian Bauer fell into three major traps that plague many givers, male and female, in their dealings with other people: being too trusting, too empathetic, and too timid. In this chapter, my goal is to show you how successful givers like Jason Geller avoid these risks, and how givers like Lillian learn to overcome them by acting less selfless and more otherish. Becoming a doormat is the giver’s worst nightmare, and I’ll make the case that an otherish approach enables givers to escape the trap of being too trusting by becoming highly flexible and adaptable in their reciprocity styles. I’ll also argue that an otherish style helps givers sidestep the land mines of being too empathetic and too timid by repurposing some skills that come naturally to them.

Instead of contemplating Rich’s feelings, Peter considered what Rich was thinking. This led to a powerful insight: Rich seemed interested in working on a new challenge, so Peter could appeal to Rich’s self-interest. “You’re clearly not enjoying running the business day-to-day,” Peter told Rich, “so why don’t you let me handle it? I think I’m old enough now that I’m ready for the heavy lifting.” Rich agreed, expressing a desire to work on special projects in the entrepreneurial space to generate new revenue for the business. Peter supported the decision and started running board meetings. Peter accomplished this maneuver by getting inside Rich’s head, rather than his heart. Studies led by Columbia psychologist Adam Galinsky show that when we empathize at the bargaining table, focusing on our counterparts’ emotions and feelings puts us at risk of giving away too much. But when we engage in perspective taking, considering our counterparts’ thoughts and interests, we’re more likely to find ways to make deals that satisfy our counterparts without sacrificing our own interests.

Ray Friedman found that in short-term, single-issue negotiations, givers do worse than takers, because they’re willing to give larger slices of the pie to their counterparts. But this disadvantage disappears entirely when the givers set high goals and stick to them—which is easier for givers to do when advocating for someone else. Advocating for others was the key to Sameer’s chump change. When he shied away from negotiating with his initial employer, Sameer was thinking about his own interests. With the Fortune 500 medical technology company, he put himself in a different frame of mind: he was representing his family’s interests. Although he might be a doormat when he was responsible for himself, being a giver meant that he didn’t want to let other people down. “I used it as a psychological weapon against myself, to motivate myself,” Sameer says. “The solution was thinking about myself as an agent, an advocate for my family. As a giver, I feel guilty about pushing too much, but the minute I start thinking, ‘I’m hurting my family, who’s depending on me for this,’ I don’t feel guilty about pushing for that side.”

Although advocating for his family helped him succeed, Sameer was still concerned about how it would affect his reputation at the firm and his relationship with his boss. When the negotiation was finished, his boss shared a surprising sentiment: he admired Sameer’s assertiveness. “It was part of why my boss wanted me,” Sameer says. “He respected that I wasn’t going to be pushed around anymore.” Givers, particularly agreeable ones, often overestimate the degree to which assertiveness might be off-putting to others. But Sameer didn’t just earn respect by virtue of negotiating; his boss was impressed with how he negotiated. When HR initially rejected Sameer’s request, he explained his family’s circumstances. “I don’t just have to worry about paying rent now. I have a family to support and loans to repay. Can you make this more palatable for me?” By asking on behalf of his family, instead of himself, Sameer was maintaining an image as a giver. He showed that he was willing to advocate for others, which sent a positive signal about how hard he would work when representing the company’s interests. Babcock and colleagues call this a relational account—an explanation for a request that highlights concern for the interests of others, not only oneself.

Ask “Why not?” Think about their choice. One of the most useful ways to uncover interests is first to identify the basic decision that those on the other side probably see you asking them for, and then to ask yourself why they have not made that decision.

The most powerful interests are basic human needs. In searching for the basic interests behind a declared position, look particularly for those bedrock concerns which motivate all people. If you can take care of such basic needs, you increase the chance both of reaching agreement and, if an agreement is reached, of the other side’s keeping to it. Basic human needs include: • security • economic well-being • a sense of belonging • recognition • control over one’s life As fundamental as they are, basic human needs are easy to overlook. In many negotiations, we tend to think that the only interest involved is money. Yet even in a negotiation over a monetary figure, such as the amount of alimony to be specified in a separation agreement, much more can be involved.

One useful rule of thumb is to give positive support to the human beings on the other side equal in strength to the vigor with which you emphasize the problem. This combination of support and attack may seem inconsistent. Psychologically, it is; the inconsistency helps make it work. A well-known theory of psychology, the theory of cognitive dissonance, holds that people dislike inconsistency and will act to eliminate it. By attacking a problem, such as speeding trucks on a neighborhood street, and at the same time giving the company representative positive support, you create cognitive dissonance for him. To overcome this dissonance, he will be tempted to dissociate himself from the problem in order to join you in doing something about it. Fighting hard on the substantive issues increases the pressure for an effective solution; giving support to the human beings on the other side tends to improve your relationship and to increase the likelihood of reaching agreement.

Searching for the single answer In most people’s minds, inventing simply is not part of the negotiating process. People see their job as narrowing the gap between positions, not broadening the options available. They tend to think, “We’re having a hard enough time agreeing as it is. The last thing we need is a bunch of different ideas.” Since the end product of negotiation is a single decision, they fear that free-floating discussion will only delay and confuse the process. If the first impediment to creative thinking is premature criticism, the second is premature closure. By looking from the outset for the single best anwer, you are likely to short-circuit a wiser decision-making process in which you select from a large number of possible answers.

Again, we can’t shameproof our children. Our task instead is teaching and modeling shame resilience, and that starts with conversations about what shame is and how it shows up in our lives. The adults I interviewed who were raised by parents who used shame as a primary parenting tool had much more difficulty believing in their worthiness than the participants who experienced shame occasionally and were able to talk about it with their parents. If you have grown children and are wondering if it’s too late to teach shame resilience or to change the album, the answer is no. It’s not too late. The power of owning our stories, even the difficult ones, is that we get to write the ending.

According to Snyder, who dedicated his career to studying this topic, hope isn’t an emotion; it’s a way of thinking or a cognitive process. Emotions play a supporting role, but hope is really a thought process made up of what Snyder calls a trilogy of goals, pathways, and agency. In very simple terms, hope happens when: We have the ability to set realistic goals (I know where I want to go). We are able to figure out how to achieve those goals, including the ability to stay flexible and develop alternative routes (I know how to get there, I’m persistent, and I can tolerate disappointment and try again). We believe in ourselves (I can do this!). So, hope is a combination of setting goals, having the tenacity and perseverance to pursue them, and believing in our own abilities. Hope is Plan B.

The Wholehearted Parenting Manifesto Above all else, I want you to know that you are loved and lovable. You will learn this from my words and actions—the lessons on love are in how I treat you and how I treat myself. I want you to engage with the world from a place of worthiness. You will learn that you are worthy of love, belonging, and joy every time you see me practice self-compassion and embrace my own imperfections. We will practice courage in our family by showing up, letting ourselves be seen, and honoring vulnerability. We will share our stories of struggle and strength. There will always be room in our home for both. We will teach you compassion by practicing compassion with ourselves first; then with each other. We will set and respect boundaries; we will honor hard work, hope, and perseverance. Rest and play will be family values, as well as family practices. You will learn accountability and respect by watching me make mistakes and make amends, and by watching how I ask for what I need and talk about how I feel. I want you to know joy, so together we will practice gratitude. I want you to feel joy, so together we will learn how to be vulnerable. When uncertainty and scarcity visit, you will be able to draw from the spirit that is a part of our everyday life. Together we will cry and face fear and grief. I will want to take away your pain, but instead I will sit with you and teach you how to feel it. We will laugh and sing and dance and create. We will always have permission to be ourselves with each other. No matter what, you will always belong here. As you begin your Wholehearted journey, the greatest gift that I can give to you is to live and love with my whole heart and to dare greatly. I will not teach or love or show you anything perfectly, but I will let you see me, and I will always hold sacred the gift of seeing you. Truly, deeply, seeing you.

When I was very young and the urge to be someplace else was on me, I was assured by mature people that maturity would cure this itch. When years described me as mature, the remedy prescribed was middle age. In middle age I was assured that greater age would calm my fever and now that I am fifty-eight perhaps senility will do the job. Nothing has worked. Four hoarse blasts of a ship’s whistle still raise the hair on my neck and set my feet to tapping. The sound of a jet, an engine warming up, even the clopping of shod hooves on pavement brings on the ancient shudder, the dry mouth and vacant eye, the hot palms and the churn of stomach high up under the rib cage. In other words, I don’t improve; in further words, once a bum always a bum. I fear the disease is incurable. I set this matter down not to instruct others but to inform myself.

In other words, I don’t improve; in further words, once a bum always a bum. I fear the disease is incurable. I set this matter down not to instruct others but to inform myself. When the virus of restlessness begins to take possession of a wayward man, and the road away from Here seems broad and straight and sweet, the victim must first find in himself a good and sufficient reason for going. This to the practical bum is not difficult. He has a built-in garden of reasons to choose from. Next he must plan his trip in time and space, choose a direction and a destination. And last he must implement the journey. How to go, what to take, how long to stay. This part of the process is invariable and immortal. I set it down only so that newcomers to bumdom, like teen-agers in new-hatched sin, will not think they invented it. Once a journey is designed, equipped, and put in process, a new factor enters and takes over. A trip, a safari, an exploration, is an entity, different from all other journeys. It has personality, temperament, individuality, uniqueness. A journey is a person in itself; no two are alike. And all plans, safeguards, policing, and coercion are fruitless. We find after years of struggle that we do not take a trip; a trip takes us. Tour masters, schedules, reservations, brass-bound and inevitable, dash themselves to wreckage on the personality of the trip. Only when this is recognized can the blown-in-the-glass bum relax and go along with it. Only then do the frustrations fall away. In this a journey is like marriage. The certain way to be wrong is to think you control it. I feel better now, having said this, although only those who have experienced it will understand it.

大概因为喉咙干渴，睁开眼睛时还不到早晨6点。在别人家里醒来，我总有一种感觉，就好像把别的魂灵硬是塞进别的体魄里似的。我勉强从狭窄的床上爬起身，走到门旁的简易水槽，像马一样一口气喝了好几杯水，又折身上床。 从大敞四开的窗口，可以隐约望见海面：粼粼细波明晃晃地折射着刚刚腾起的太阳光。凝目细看，只见脏兮兮的货轮无精打采地浮在水上。看样子将是个大热天。四周的住户仍在酣然大睡。所能听到的，唯有时而响起的电车轨的轰鸣声，和广播体操的微弱旋律。 我赤身裸体地倚着床背，点燃支烟，打量睡在旁边的女郎。从南窗直接射进的太阳光线，上上下下洒满她的全身。她把毛巾被一直蹬到脚底，睡得很香很死。形状姣好的乳房随着不时粗重的呼吸而上下摇颤。身体原本晒得恰到好处，但由于时间的往逝，颜色已开始有点黯淡。而呈泳装形状的、未被晒过的部分则白得异乎寻常，看上去竟像已趋腐烂一般。 吸罢烟，我努力回想她的名字，想了10分钟也没想起，甚至连自己是否晓得她的名字都无从记起。我只好作罢，打了个哈欠，重新打量她的身体。年龄好像离二十岁还差几岁，总的说来有点偏瘦。我最大限度地张开手指，从头部开始依序测其身长。手指挪腾了8次，最后量到脚后跟时还剩有一拇指宽的距离——大约158厘米。 右乳房的下边有块浅痣，10元硬币大小，如洒上的酱油。 小腹处绒绒的阴毛，犹如洪水过后的小河水草一样生得整整齐齐，倒也赏心悦目。此外，她的左手只有4根手指。

第三个同我睡觉的女孩，称我的阳物为“你存在的理由”。 以前，我曾想以人存在的理由为主题写一部短篇小说。小说归终没有完成，而我在那时间里由于连续不断地就人存在的理由进行思考，结果染上了一种怪癖：凡事非换算成数值不可。我在这种冲动的驱使下整整生活了8个月之久。乘电车时先数乘客的人数，数楼梯的级数，一有时间就测量脉搏跳动的次数。据当时的记录，1969年8月15日至翌年4月3日之间，我听课358次，性交54次，吸烟6，921支。 那些日子里，我当真以为这种将一切换算成数值的做法也许能向别人传达什么。并且深信只要有什么东西向别人传达，我便可以确确实实地存在。然而无须说，任何人都不会对我吸烟的支数、所上楼梯的级数以及阳物的尺寸怀有半点兴致。我感到自己失去了存在的理由，只落得顾盼自怜。

separating the act of developing options from the act of deciding on them is extremely useful in any negotiation. Discussing options differs radically from taking positions. Whereas one side’s position will conflict with another’s, options invite other options. The very language you use differs. It consists of questions, not assertions; it is open, not closed: “One option is .... What other options have you thought of?”

Multiply options by shuttling between the specific and the general: The Circle Chart. The task of inventing options involves four types of thinking. One is thinking about a particular problem—the factual situation you dislike, for example, a smelly, polluted river that runs by your land. The second type of thinking is descriptive analysis—you diagnose an existing situation in general terms. You sort problems into categories and tentatively suggest causes. The river water may have a high content of various chemicals, or too little oxygen. You may suspect various upstream industrial plants. The third type of thinking, again in general terms, is to consider what ought, perhaps, to be done. Given the diagnoses you have made, you look for prescriptions that theory may suggest, such as reducing chemical effluent, reducing diversions of water, or bringing fresh water from some other river. The fourth and final type of thinking is to come up with some specific and feasible suggestions for action. Who might do what tomorrow to put one of these general approaches into practice? For instance, the state environmental agency might order an upstream industry to limit the quantity of chemical discharge.

Change the scope of a proposed agreement. Consider the possibility of varying not only the strength of the agreement but also its scope. You could, for instance, “fractionate” your problem into smaller and perhaps more manageable units. To a prospective editor for your book, you might suggest: “How about editing the first chapter for $300, and we’ll see how it goes?” Agreements may be partial, involve fewer parties, cover only selected subject matters, apply only to a certain geographical area, or remain in effect for only a limited period of time.

Agreement is often based on disagreement. It is as absurd to think, for example, that you should always begin by reaching agreement on the facts as it is for a buyer of stock to try to convince the seller that the stock is likely to go up. If they did agree that the stock would go up, the seller would probably not sell. What makes a deal likely is that the buyer believes the price will go up and the seller believes it will go down. The difference in belief provides the basis for a deal. Many creative agreements reflect this principle of reaching agreement through differences. Differences in interests and belief make it possible for an item to be high benefit to you, yet low cost to the other side. Consider the nursery rhyme:   Jack Sprat could eat no fat His wife could eat no lean, And so betwixt them both They licked the platter clean.

Ask for their preferences. One way to dovetail interests is to invent several options all equally acceptable to you and ask the other side which one they prefer. You want to know what is preferable, not necessarily what is acceptable. You can then take that option, work with it some more, and again present two or more variants, asking which one they prefer. In this way, without anyone’s making a decision, you can improve a plan until you can find no more joint gains. For example, the agent for the baseball star might ask the team owner: “What meets your interests better, a salary of $875,000 a year for four years, or $1,000,000 a year for three years? The latter? OK, how about between that and $900,000 a year for three years with a $500,000 bonus in each year if Fernando pitches better than a 3.00 ERA?” If dovetailing had to be summed up in one sentence, it would be: Look for items that are of low cost to you and high benefit to them, and vice versa. Differences in interests, priorities, beliefs, forecasts, and attitudes toward risk all make dovetailing possible. A negotiator’s motto could be “Vive la différence!”

In Chapter 2 we discussed how one can understand the other side’s interests by analyzing their currently perceived choice. Now you are trying to generate options that will so change their choice that they might then decide in a way satisfactory to you. Your task is to give them not a problem but an answer, to give them not a tough decision but an easy one. It is crucial in that process to focus your attention on the content of the decision itself. That decision is often impeded by uncertainty.

Muscle control in the central nervous system breaks down into three distinct categories. There are muscles that we can activate consciously, in what doctors call the somatic nervous system. When you decide to walk across the room, your brain fires the nerves that activate muscles all up through the legs, back, and stomach at once. We don’t need to think about every muscle involved in taking a step, we just do it. Still, with some deliberate thought we can individually fire any one of them. This is all part of the somatic system. There are also muscles that we have almost no control over whatsoever. These include muscles that control the pace of the heart, the motion of the vascular system, the speed of digestion, and the dilation of our pupils. All of these are part of the autonomic nervous system—the body’s version of autopilot. But there’s a third group of muscles and reactions that are shared between the autonomic and somatic systems. Any one of us can decide to take a breath or blink our eyes, but if we let our minds wander, some deep part of our nervous system takes over. If you want to, you can hijack control away from some automatic processes with a thought, but when your mind drifts away, they continue on their own. This is a good thing: With such a system there’s no way that you can simply forget to breathe.

When the students are bleached white from exhaustion, Hof commands them to let all the air out of their lungs and not to breathe in until their bodies shake and shudder. I exhale into the frigid cold and wonder if it was a good idea to come here in the first place. “Fainting is okay,” he says. “It just means you went deep.” My lungs are empty and my head dizzy from hyperventilation. I note the time on my stopwatch as it slowly ticks forward. At 30 seconds I want to let go and feel the cool air rush inside. But I hold on. At 60 seconds my diaphragm begins to quiver and I have to rock back and forth to keep from gasping. Even so, my mind is strangely calm. I close my eyes and see red, ghostlike shapes flit behind my lids. Later, Hof will explain that the light is a window into my pituitary gland. I will frown at the explanation. I am the only skeptic in the room.

We cycle between hyperventilating and holding our breath for almost an hour, and every repetition makes it incrementally easier to hold on just a little bit longer. Hof tells us that the quick breathing adds oxygen to our blood supply so that, at least until we use it up, we won’t have to rely on the air in our lungs to survive. The autonomic urge to gasp for air is based on the mind’s ordinary programming: No air in the lungs means it’s time to breathe. My nervous system has not yet realized there is still oxygen in my bloodstream.1 The heavy breathing lets me trick my nervous system into doing things that it isn’t evolutionarily designed for. In other words, I am hacking my body.

Although the first day of exercises is painful and exhausting, true to Hof’s word our progress is rapid. The next day we stand in the snow for 15 minutes before the same feeling of panic sets in. In the afternoon we take a brief dip in the basin of an ice-cold waterfall that is a 5-minute walk from Hof’s back door. With every attempt, the barriers that we’ve built in our minds about the cold recede a little further.

What we know about how the human body reacts to cold comes mostly from gruesomely accurate studies that emerged from the Dachau death camp. Nazis tracked Jewish prisoners’ core temperatures as they died in ice water. As terrible as they are, these morally compromised studies have helped doctors understand how quickly the body loses heat in such conditions. Sitting in 32-degree water, humans begin to feel sluggish after only a minute or two. By 15 minutes most people fall unconscious. They die between 15 and 45 minutes depending on their underlying physiology. When the core body temperature falls below 82 degrees, death is almost inevitable. Measured against that data set, Hof seems to perform miracles.

The moment I take off my shirt I start to get a sense of how our primordial ancestors would have handled the same march. Trudging forward I don’t feel the bite of the cold the way I did before undergoing the regime at camp. Whatever heat I build up through exertion seems to stay in my skin as if I am wearing a wetsuit. I can feel the cold, but it never penetrates. I never shiver. Instead, I focus on the point behind my ears that Hof says will help activate my brown fat and send waves of heat through my body. I imitate what I witnessed Hof do in the sauna. With my muscles clenched and my mind focused, it isn’t long before I start to sweat. A thin, steamy mist wafts upward from the group. A skier stops to take pictures. A ski patrolman on a snowmobile pauses to see if we were okay. A snowboarder lets out a shocked cry and speeds by as we plod forward to the summit. The strangest thing is that we aren’t suffering at all; we are elated. Cold and exercise trigger an enormous endorphin release that pastes a maniacal grin across my face.

Some people’s sensory hardware scrambles the inputs between senses so that they can taste colors and hear smells, a condition called synesthesia. The neurological jumble usually doesn’t interfere with synesthetes’ daily lives, and indeed many go on to be extraordinarily successful and creative—from the author Vladimir Nabokov to the scientist Richard Feynman.

In broad strokes, however, thermogenic research has showed four main strategies that the body can use to resist the cold: Humans can increase their metabolic rate by shivering; they can stay warm through some passive metabolic mechanism; or they can shunt blood to their core by closing off the veins in their extremities. Lastly, as in most cases of people who live in colder climates, the human body can also accumulate higher levels of ordinary white fat as an insulation to help stem heat loss in the first place. Anthropologists credited the different strategies to genetic adaptations that evolved from people reproducing in diverse environments and not necessarily a sign of evolutionary abilities shared among all humans. However, by 2009 Steegman’s hypothesis about brown fat was about to find an unlikely champion when new science had the potential to turn the entire field of human thermogenesis on its head.

So it’s going to be an odd year. On one hand, I need to maintain a certain level of fitness so that I can actually measure the effects, if any, of the Wim Hof Method. On the other hand, I’m going to explore different parts of the world where people use the environment to train their body. I want to slog in the mud with the Spartans and train with people crazy enough to surf monster waves. I even have plans for trying to persuade Hof to take me on one of his death-defying expeditions.

Sneezing is one of the body’s many defensive responses against environmental threats. The neural circuitry between the nasal passage and the sneezing center in the brainstem is only a few inches long, and it is one of our most primal reflexive pathways. While sneezing can be pleasurable in small doses—indeed the brain patterns of a sneeze recorded in an MRI resemble mini-orgasms—an unremitting cascade of them is no fun.

The body will literally get high on excess oxygen, and the constant air circulation in the lungs tends to cool the blood down as well. It’s much less common, but possible, to faint while doing controlled hyperventilation or during a breath-hold. It is slightly more common to pass out during breath retentions when your lungs are full—while empty lung retentions will prompt the gasp reflex earlier. If you fall unconscious, your body will quickly reset to its automatic programming and you’ll wake up within a minute. In my experience there is an increased chance of fainting while doing the exercises with full lungs, since the increased volume of air throws off the way my body detects CO2. Once, after reaching 80 pushups, my arm collapsed and I banged my forehead on the wood floor. The bump on my head was an indication that I’d found my limit.

That’s the physical side of the exercise, but there’s a mental routine that you can do alongside the breathing. One of the goals of this practice is to shut down the higher cognitive functions so that you can communicate directly with your lower brain functions. The brain burns far more energy than any other part of the body. In a typical day an adult male burns 2,200 calories, but the brain gobbles up 15 to 20 percent of that energy. To put this into context: If you charge up all 1,576 stairs from the ground floor to the observation deck of the Empire State Building, your muscles will burn only 54 calories, which is roughly the equivalent of a single Oreo cookie. (This is not to say that going up all those flights of stairs won’t burn calories, but most of the additional energy actually stems from increased circulation and heart rate.) If you can turn down even a few of the brain’s higher functions, you will see a vast improvement in your ability to hold your breath. And there is no better tool to dissect and modulate the inner workings of the mind than meditation. People have been meditating for thousands of years. The very earliest written descriptions of meditation emerged in India almost 3,500 years ago.

Start by closing your eyes. Clear away any thoughts or mental clutter from your day. Don’t muse over the bills you have to pay, the conversation at the office water cooler, or what a friend said the other day. Just sit in one place and try to be in the moment. Notice that you might be able to make out shapes in the blackness. Perhaps you see small flecks of reds, blues, and greens, or maybe there is a blotch of color floating out in space. If you don’t see anything, don’t worry about it, just look at the blackness itself. But, maybe it looks as if there are electric currents in the play of lights. Notice the outlines of the shapes and try to sense how deep the space in front of you really is. Is it a shallow blackness that stops at your eyelids, or is it a deep and spacious void? Simply observe the character of what you see. If you start to think about other things, let them go and gently guide your focus back to just looking at the shapes you see. Imagine that some of those shapes are actually light and try to feel that light entering your body. Let the light come in through your eyes or through your forehead and let it flow down your spine and out to your fingers and your toes. Keep focusing on the movement of the colors and start the power breathing. Take 30 breaths while focusing on the light and as you begin to hold your breath. Notice how your body feels. Are you dizzy? Do your fingers or toes itch? Are you cold? Or hot? Feel your body and imagine that the light you can see stretches all the way to your toes and is actually air. Imagine that you’re filling your body with light and with air as you hold your breath. Then, as holding back from breathing gets difficult, start to clench your muscles from your toes on upward and think that you are pushing air up to your head. Notice how it feels, and when you have to breathe, do it. Repeat this cycle of visualization until you can hold your breath for at least 3 minutes. There are many explanations of what happens during meditation visualizations. Monks, yogis, and Chinese meditation practitioners say that the colors correspond to a system of spinning chakras (wheel-like torrents of energy) that make up a human’s spiritual anatomy. Others argue that the colors indicate the metabolic functions of specific organs. Most scientists say there is no proof that the shapes a person sees are anything more than just the meaningless static of the brain. Whatever the truth of the matter, the visualizations are real experiences. When you give yourself a way to connect the visual information behind your eyes to the sensations in your extremities you have unlocked a tool for taking control of the process of the immune system itself. The combination of breathing exercises, muscle flexing, and visualization are the basic core exercises of Hof’s training.

While you’re in this moment of shock and pain, you have two basic goals. First, you need to control your breathing and keep calm. The sensations that most closely match the feeling of burning will dissipate if you focus your mind on the pain. Try to relax instead of tightly clenching up every muscle. Enduring the snow is the same exact mental trick as trying to delay a sneeze or resist being ticklish. Once you feel reasonably calm, the second thing you need to master is suppressing your impulse to shiver. After the initial shock of the cold recedes, your body will soon click on an instinctual program to warm itself through muscle movement. It’s up to you to keep that at bay. Shivering will certainly use up a lot of calories, and for this reason it can be useful if you want to lose weight. But your goal here is to command your nervous system to submit to your will. If your body can’t shiver itself warm again or rely on the insulating properties of your white fat, its only remaining option is to start ramping up your metabolism. This is to say, you will begin passively generating brown fat and building up your stores of mitochondria if you can suppress your shiver response.

A 15-MINUTE DAILY WORKOUT My daily routine mixes elements of all these practices, plus a few more I borrowed from a local yoga class. I always start before breakfast, when my circulatory system is the most active and hasn’t yet been weighed down by the process of digestion. I begin with three rounds of power breathing followed by a breath-hold with no air in my lungs. I time myself and try to add a minute to each breath-hold until I hit 3 minutes. Then I do another round of breathing followed by 50 breath-out pushups. I follow this with a headstand for 30 seconds to let blood move to my head. I usually start my shower warm, but finish with at least a minute of cold water. I get out feeling refreshed and pumped full of endorphins. On top of that I do some kind of cardio exercise outside about three times a week. All together it really isn’t very time consuming. It’s also pretty much all I will do to prepare myself for the coming challenges.

Never yield to pressure. Consider once again the example of negotiating with the contractor. What if he offers to hire your brother-in-law on the condition that you give in on the depth of the foundations? You would probably answer, “A job for my brother-in-law has nothing to do with whether the house will be safely supported on a foundation of that depth.” What if the contractor then threatens to charge you a higher price? You would answer the same way: “We’ll settle that question on the merits too. Let’s see what other contractors charge for this kind of work,” or “Bring me your cost figures and we’ll work out a fair profit margin.” If the contractor replies, “Come on, you trust me, don’t you?” you would respond: “Trust is an entirely separate matter. The issue is how deep the foundations have to be to make the house safe.” Pressure can take many forms: a bribe, a threat, a manipulative appeal to trust, or a simple refusal to budge. In all these cases, the principled response is the same: invite them to state their reasoning, suggest objective criteria you think apply, and refuse to budge except on this basis. Never yield to pressure, only to principle.

The reason you negotiate is to produce something better than the results you can obtain without negotiating. What are those results? What is that alternative? What is your BATNA—your Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement? That is the standard against which any proposed agreement should be measured. That is the only standard which can protect you both from accepting terms that are too unfavorable and from rejecting terms it would be in your interest to accept. Your BATNA not only is a better measure but also has the advantage of being flexible enough to permit the exploration of imaginative solutions. Instead of ruling out any solution which does not meet your bottom line, you can compare a proposal with your BATNA to see whether it better satisfies your interests.

The solution is to start breathing hard long before you actually feel the need to. The most obvious application for this technique is with running. A typical adult takes about 15 breaths every minute when they are at rest, but will start breathing 40 to 50 breaths per minute during periods of intensive exercise until they hit their VO2 max. An untrained runner will breathe faster as they reach their limit, but they typically draw shallow breaths that don’t give their lungs a chance to maximize oxygen absorption. By anticipating what the body is going to do, Hamilton says anyone can tweak their physiology for better performance.

It’s not uncommon to hallucinate during longer breath-holds. The deprivation of oxygen peels back layers of the brain, shutting them down until you reach a sort of primal center of human existence. The brain’s electrical patterns fire in sporadic ways as a person begins to lose consciousness. The process is rooted in our basic biology, but for Hamilton the experience has deeper meaning than a simple physical reaction. “Breathing lets you go deep,” he says to me later, describing how his 20-minute morning routine of deep breathing and breath-holding has led him to places he never expected he would reach. “Sometimes I’ll see a face looking back at me and I know that it’s my own soul. At other times it feels like I’m floating above my body looking down at myself meditating.” The face he sees most, he says, resembles the crude features of the comic book hero the Silver Surfer—something that is otherworldly and yet also human. I’m not entirely surprised that the deity he identifies with owns a surfboard. It is open to debate whether what I’ve seen on the edge of unconsciousness is a connection to something that truly transcends the world we live in or is instead the machinations of my hypoxic mind attempting to create meaning out of meaningless physical phenomenon. Clinical literature often reports different types of hallucinations that can occur during meditation, and in most cases the experiences don’t correlate with an underlying mental health condition. In India and China, yogis who use similar breathing techniques, called pranayama in Sanskrit, or qi breathing in Mandarin, frequently report experiencing visions. In fact, most Eastern traditions believe that breath control can engender profound spiritual insights. For Hamilton and, indeed, many people who delve deeply into their own physiology through meditation or yoga, there is an intrinsic connection between the body and the soul, and every such experience has the potential to open a window into something greater. Whatever it means, just like a dream the experience itself is real.

In January Hof plans to summit the tallest mountain in Africa—Mount Kilimanjaro, a soaring 19,341 feet above sea level—in just two shirtless days. The trek won’t be all that difficult from a mountaineering perspective, but doing it Hof’s way is a serious test of human mettle. Kilimanjaro isn’t formidable because of rockslides or long rope ascents on bare rock walls, but for its high incidence of altitude sickness in expeditions. As a hiker trudges upward, the air grows ever thinner and the atmospheric pressure ever lower. Eventually the air gets so sparse that oxygen can’t circulate efficiently throughout the body. When the dizziness progresses to full-blown acute mountain sickness—AMS for short—the heart starts to beat irregularly and the lungs can fill with fluid until it becomes impossible to breathe. Five to 10 people die every year on Kilimanjaro ascents. To stave off this condition mountaineers slowly acclimate on their way to the top, ascending in easy stages so that their bodies can produce more red blood cells and get used to the thinning air. Alternately they dose themselves with a drug called Diamox, which helps them adapt to the altitude. A typical Kilimanjaro ascent takes a minimum of 5 days, plus another 3 or 4 to get back down. Even going at that pace, only about 45 percent of people who attempt the summit make it. Hof claims that with focus and concentrated breathing he can take 20 people to the summit at a pace that most mountaineers would call reckless. But then again it sounds exactly like the sort of challenge I need to prove that the training has actually changed me.

At its foot is the sum total of Wim’s personal wardrobe: a white plastic trash bag full of dirty clothes, a hopelessly wrinkled white sports coat, an orange swimsuit, and a few towels. The pile sits discarded on a stained brown carpet. I stare at the collection for a minute. Part of me despairs what a week in such Spartan quarters will feel like, while the other part marvels at the disjunction between the worldwide fame and riches, associated with the training empire, and the way Hof chooses to live. Wim is many things, but he is clearly not motivated by material trappings.

Think of it this way: Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative process in which the brain slowly loses connections with the limbs it is supposed to command, and Spaans uses the Wim Hof Method to strengthen environmental signals to override his failing neurology. It isn’t a cure. It’s a management routine. In 2015 he is enjoying 11.5 hours of “good time” every day with a lower drug regimen as compared with 2011, when his daily average of “good time” dipped to less than 7 hours. And that progress is more hope than any doctor has given him so far. It’s an unorthodox approach—one that his doctor thinks is nothing more than a placebo effect—but at least Spaans can speak about his future again.

The doctor told him it would be a long recovery. Furthermore, a large purple horseshoe-shaped bruise stretched over his kidney. A nurse offered him an opium-based pain medication while he waited for surgery, but he turned it down. For him, the broken bone was an opportunity for him to practice pain control. The nurse was shocked. She’d never had anyone in his position refuse morphine, but he did. So, long after adrenaline had blunted his pain, van der Meulen breathed consciously for hours and visualized light moving from his lungs to his arm in lieu of a much easier path to painlessness. The doctors fitted him with a temporary cast and scheduled a surgery for 4 days later. He spent the evening meditating on his injuries, and when he came in for a follow-up appointment the next day the bruises on his ribs and kidneys were gone. The nurse wondered why van der Meulen wasn’t healing like a normal person. When he finally was admitted to the operating room a few days later, he turned down the drugs again. Doctors gave him only a local anesthetic as they opened up his flesh to set the bone. A few hours later, when he emerged from surgery, a yellowish incision spanned from his wrist halfway to his elbow with broad, inelegant sutures. A nurse told him that he would have to wait for 2 weeks before they could be removed, but asked him to come back the next day so the doctors could have a look at how the surgery took. Van der Meulen spent the next 4 hours breathing and focusing on his arm. When he tells me this story, I have trouble wrapping my mind around the amount of concentration it must have taken. The effort was constant, but he tells me that it seemed to pay off. When he finally grew tired and went to bed that night, all that was left were the stitches; the resultant swelling from the surgery had markedly subsided. He shows me pictures to prove it. The next day the nurse was shocked. “Well that went quickly,” he remembers her saying. “In about two weeks the sutures should start to itch, and then you can come back and we’ll take them out.” Van der Meulen didn’t have to wait quite that long. Three days later the sutures began to itch, but when he called the hospital they said it was far too early to remove them. So his wife took them out herself using a pair of kitchen scissors. When he finally came back to the hospital for his scheduled appointment, the nurse examined both of his arms but the injured limb had healed so neatly that she couldn’t tell which one had been through surgery without asking van der Meulen. When the doctor looked for himself he shrugged. “You are certainly a medical anomaly,” he told his patient.

November Project is now responsible for a continent-wide code of weather invulnerability. Is it minus 30 in Toronto? Whatever, it’s time for jumping jacks.

Also with us is Scott Keneally, the 6-foot-5 documentary filmmaker who introduced me to Laird Hamilton. Scott has long hair and, like the growing number of people I’ve been meeting at these kinds of events, is covered in webs of tattoos. He also has a contagious smile that’s surprisingly effective at convincing friends to do stupid things with him. For the last 3 years he’s been working on a movie called Rise of the Sufferfests about the sudden explosion of obstacle course racing (OCR), which has become one of the most popular weekend sports in the world. His reporting, which has appeared in a series of magazine articles for Outside and Men’s Journal, traces injury rates and controversies in the OCR business. He’s just flown in from Northern California, and we’re both here to run Tough Guy. But for him the trip has a more personal project at stake: He’s going to be screening his film for the first time in front of a small audience of racers. Among them will be Mr. Mouse, the octogenarian grandfather of all obstacle courses, who may or may not like his portrayal in the film. Mr. Mouse, aka Billy Wilson, is a former member of the British Army’s Grenadier Guards and carried a light machine gun in their Cyprus and Suez Canal campaigns. Though he saw some combat he spent most of his tours as the regimental barber, shaving men’s heads and grooming their mustaches. When he retired from service he moved to a rustic, sprawling farm in a small village outside the town of Wolverhampton in the English midlands. The house was once briefly the home of William Shakespeare, or so he claims. Wilson started a string of successful barbershops in the town, and he made a name for himself with outrageous promotions featuring topless women he said were his staff barbers. Customers queued up for cuts and took their spot on his chair even though the buxom blondes were pure fiction. He made a fortune, but it wasn’t enough for him. He wanted to make a mark on the world. An accomplished runner, Wilson believed that it was possible to help move toward world peace through sporting events. If he could find a way to direct the violent tendencies of wayward youths toward sport, then he might be able to mold them into productive members of society. This is why Tough Guy is more than just a race. It’s the spiritual center of the entire obstacle course race industry.

Everyone else is recovering and waiting for a hot lunch that we’d been told was on the way. Hof checks the time. It’s 11:40. Then he shouts, “Okay, everyone. We go in twenty minutes. We’re not on the mountain because we want to eat. We’re here to make the summit.” The message lands flat in a room full of confused faces. I’m not the only one to mutter an obscenity. Sensing insubordination, Hof revises his message 3 minutes later. “Never mind rest,” he says. “We go now and make a new record!”

Then, before I know it, we’re there. Breathless at the top of the African continent. Maybe just a little shy of the true peak, but when we check our watches and subtract away our departure time we calculate that we’ve more than beaten our 30-hour goal; we’ve crushed it. It has been only 28 hours and 6 minutes since we left the park entrance. To put that in perspective, when Hof’s group did the same trek the year before, it took them 42 hours to reach Gilman’s Point. To the best of our knowledge it is the fastest-ever ascent to Gilman’s Point by a group of people. Somewhere below us the rest of the group is on their way up. They will reach the same point in about 2 hours. Altogether, 22 out of 29 will make it to the top without succumbing to AMS. Though Castellani and the US Army predicted mostly failure, we will achieve a 75 percent expedition success rate. And so I breathe in that success in Kilimanjaro’s thinnest air. The wind whips past the large, wooden sign that marks the elevation, and I start to feel warm again. I take another 30 breaths and I’m hot. So I take off my shirt again to feel the weather on my skin. Even if the wind only speaks in the language of frostbite, it feels like victory. I’m not on the mountain anymore. In this moment, I am the mountain.

Throughout history, religions and ideologies did not sanctify life itself. They always sanctified something above or beyond earthly existence, and were consequently quite tolerant of death. Indeed, some of them have been downright fond of the Grim Reaper. Because Christianity, Islam and Hinduism insisted that the meaning of our existence depended on our fate in the afterlife, they viewed death as a vital and positive part of the world. Humans died because God decreed it, and their moment of death was a sacred metaphysical experience exploding with meaning. When a human was about to breathe his last, this was the time to call priests, rabbis and shamans, to draw out the balance of life, and to embrace one’s true role in the universe. Just try to imagine Christianity, Islam or Hinduism in a world without death – which is also a world without heaven, hell or reincarnation.

How exactly do humans die? Medieval fairy tales depicted Death as a figure in a hooded black cloak, his hand gripping a large scythe. A man lives his life, worrying about this and that, running here and there, when suddenly the Grim Reaper appears before him, taps him on the shoulder with a bony finger and says, ‘Come!’ And the man implores: ‘No, please! Wait just a year, a month, a day!’ But the hooded figure hisses: ‘No! You must come NOW!’ And this is how we die. In reality,

we die. In reality, however, humans don’t die because a figure in a black cloak taps them on the shoulder, or because God decreed it, or because mortality is an essential part of some great cosmic plan. Humans always die due to some technical glitch. The heart stops pumping blood. The main artery is clogged by fatty deposits. Cancerous cells spread in the liver. Germs multiply in the lungs. And what is responsible for all these technical problems? Other technical problems. The heart stops pumping blood because not enough oxygen reaches the heart muscle.

Well-kept lawns demanded land and a lot of work, particularly in the days before lawnmowers and automatic water sprinklers. In exchange, they produce nothing of value. You can’t even graze animals on them, because they would eat and trample the grass. Poor peasants could not afford wasting precious land or time on lawns. The neat turf at the entrance to chateaux was accordingly a status symbol nobody could fake. It boldly proclaimed to every passerby: ‘I am so rich and powerful, and I have so many acres and serfs, that I can afford this green extravaganza.’ The bigger and neater the lawn, the more powerful the dynasty. If you came to visit a duke and saw that his lawn was in bad shape, you knew he was in trouble.50

How does “negotiation jujitsu” work in practice? How do you sidestep their attack and deflect it against the problem? Typically their “attack” will consist of three maneuvers: asserting their position forcefully, attacking your ideas, and attacking you. Let’s consider how a principled negotiator can deal with each of these. Don’t attack their position, look behind it. When the other side sets forth their position, neither reject it nor accept it. Treat it as one possible option. Look for the interests behind it, seek out the principles which it reflects, and think about ways to improve it.

Ask questions and pause. Those engaged in negotiation jujitsu use two key tools. The first is to use questions instead of statements. Statements generate resistance, whereas questions generate answers. Questions allow the other side to get their points across and let you understand them. They pose challenges and can be used to lead the other side to confront the problem. Questions offer them no target to strike at, no position to attack. Questions do not criticize, they educate. “Do you think it would be better to have teachers cooperating in a process they felt they were participating in, or actively resisting one they felt was imposed on them and failed to take their concerns into account?” Silence is one of your best weapons. Use it. If they have made an unreasonable proposal or an attack you regard as unjustified, the best thing to do may be to sit there and not say a word. If you have asked an honest question to which they have provided an insufficient answer, just wait. People tend to feel uncomfortable with silence, particularly if they have doubts about the merits of something they have said.

Silence often creates the impression of a stalemate which the other side will feel impelled to break by answering your question or coming up with a new suggestion. When you ask questions, pause. Don’t take them off the hook by going right on with another question or some comment of your own. Some of the most effective negotiating you will ever do is when you are not talking.

In recent years, as people began to rethink human–animal relations, such practices have come under increasing criticism. We are suddenly showing unprecedented interest in the fate of so-called lower life forms, perhaps because we are about to become one. If and when computer programs attain superhuman intelligence and unprecedented power, should we begin valuing these programs more than we value humans? Would it be okay, for example, for an artificial intelligence to exploit humans and even kill them to further its own needs and desires? If it should never be allowed to do that, despite its superior intelligence and power, why is it ethical for humans to exploit and kill pigs? Do humans have some magical spark, in addition to higher intelligence and greater power, which distinguishes them from pigs, chickens, chimpanzees and computer programs alike? If yes, where did that spark come from, and why are we certain that an AI could never acquire it? If there is no such spark, would there be any reason to continue assigning special value to human life even after computers surpass humans in intelligence and power? Indeed, what exactly is it about humans that make us so intelligent and powerful in the first place, and how likely is it that non-human entities will ever rival and surpass us?

The theory of relativity makes nobody angry, because it doesn’t contradict any of our cherished beliefs. Most people don’t care an iota whether space and time are absolute or relative. If you think it is possible to bend space and time, well, be my guest. Go ahead and bend them. What do I care? In contrast, Darwin has deprived us of our souls. If you really understand the theory of evolution, you understand that there is no soul. This is a terrifying thought not only to devout Christians and Muslims, but also to many secular people who don’t hold any clear religious dogma, but nevertheless want to believe that each human possesses an eternal individual essence that remains unchanged throughout life, and can survive even death intact.

少量有限不可能性的产生原理自然很容易理解，只需要把班布尔维尼五七型亚介子脑的逻辑回路缠绕在悬挂于强布朗运动发生器（比方说一杯喷香的热茶）中的原子矢量绘图仪上即可——这样的构造机制配合不确定性原理，可以让构成女主人的内衣的所有原子同时向左跃迁一英尺，通常用于打破派对上的冰冷气氛。 许多备受尊敬的物理学家说他们绝不容忍如此手段的存在，一部分是因为它降低了科学的品质，但更多却是因为这种派对从不邀请他们参加。 他们还有一件无法容忍的事情，那就是在试图建造能够产生无限不可能性场的机器时遭遇了连场挫败，要将飞船掷过最遥远的恒星间那令大脑失去思考能力的距离，无限不可能性场是必不可少的东西。最后，他们恼怒地宣布这种机器根本不可能存在。 然后，有一天，一场格外不成功的派对过后，一名被留下来打扫实验室的学生发现他可以这样思考问题： 假如，他在脑海里设想道，假如一种机器完全不可能存在，那从逻辑上说这就是一个有限不可能性事件。那么，想制造这种机器，我只需要去弄清楚这究竟有多不可能，然后将数字喂进有限不可能性产生仪，再添上一杯新煮的滚烫香茶……再然后，拨动开关！ 他这样做了，颇为惊讶地发现他真的凭空造出了人们苦苦寻觅已久的珍贵的无限不可能性产生仪。 更让他惊讶的是，就在他荣获银河学院的无比聪明奖之后，一群备受尊敬的物理学家化身为狂怒的暴徒，私刑处决了他，这群家伙终于意识到，他们最无法容忍的其实是自作聪明的人。

Philosophers have encapsulated this riddle in a trick question: what happens in the mind that doesn’t happen in the brain? If nothing happens in the mind except what happens in our massive network of neurons – then why do we need the mind? If something does indeed happen in the mind over and above what happens in the neural network – where the hell does it happen?

Jet engines roar loudly, but the noise doesn’t propel the aeroplane forward. Humans don’t need carbon dioxide, but each and every breath fills the air with more of the stuff. Similarly, consciousness may be a kind of mental pollution produced by the firing of complex neural networks. It doesn’t do anything. It is just there. If this is true, it implies that all the pain and pleasure experienced by billions of creatures for millions of years is just mental pollution. This is certainly a thought worth thinking, even if it isn’t true. But it is quite amazing to realise that as of 2016, this is the best theory of consciousness that contemporary science has to offer us.

Consciousness is the biologically useless by-product of certain brain processes. Jet engines roar loudly, but the noise doesn’t propel the aeroplane forward.

Already thousands of years ago philosophers realised that there is no way to prove conclusively that anyone other than oneself has a mind. Indeed, even in the case of other humans, we just assume they have consciousness – we cannot know that for certain. Perhaps I am the only being in the entire universe who feels anything, and all other humans and animals are just mindless robots? Perhaps I am dreaming, and everyone I meet is just a character in my dream? Perhaps I am trapped inside a virtual world, and all the beings I see are merely simulations? According to current scientific dogma, everything I experience is the result of electrical activity in my brain, and it should therefore be theoretically feasible to simulate an entire virtual world that I could not possibly distinguish from the ‘real’ world. Some brain scientists believe that in the not too distant future, we shall actually do such things. Well, maybe it has already been done – to you? For all you know, the year might be 2216 and you are a bored teenager immersed inside a ‘virtual world’ game that simulates the primitive and exciting world of the early twenty-first century. Once you acknowledge the mere feasibility of this scenario, mathematics leads you to a very scary conclusion: since there is only one real world, whereas the number of potential virtual worlds is infinite, the probability that you happen to inhabit the sole real world is almost zero.

Humans nowadays completely dominate the planet not because the individual human is far smarter and more nimble-fingered than the individual chimp or wolf, but because Homo sapiens is the only species on earth capable of co-operating flexibly in large numbers. Intelligence and toolmaking were obviously very important as well. But if humans had not learned to cooperate flexibly in large numbers, our crafty brains and deft hands would still be splitting flint stones rather than uranium atoms. If cooperation is the key, how come the ants and bees did not beat us to the nuclear bomb even though they learned to cooperate en masse millions of years before us? Because their cooperation lacks flexibility. Bees cooperate in very sophisticated ways, but they cannot reinvent their social system overnight. If a hive faces a new threat or a new opportunity, the bees cannot, for example, guillotine the queen and establish a republic. Social mammals such as elephants and chimpanzees cooperate far more flexibly than bees, but they do so only with small numbers of friends and family members. Their cooperation is based on personal acquaintance. If I am a chimpanzee and you are a chimpanzee and I want to cooperate with you, I must know you personally: what kind of chimp are you? Are you a nice chimp? Are you an evil chimp? How can I cooperate with you if I don’t know you? To the best of our knowledge, only Sapiens can cooperate in very flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers. This concrete capability – rather than an eternal soul or some unique kind of consciousness – explains our mastery of planet Earth.

That’s how history unfolds. People weave a web of meaning, believe in it with all their heart, but sooner or later the web unravels, and when we look back we cannot understand how anybody could have taken it seriously. With hindsight, going on crusade in the hope of reaching Paradise sounds like utter madness. With hindsight, the Cold War seems even madder. How come thirty years ago people were willing to risk nuclear holocaust because of their belief in a communist paradise? A hundred years hence, our belief in democracy and human rights might look equally incomprehensible to our descendants.

In contrast, if an English youth decided to join Amnesty International and travel to Syria to protect the human rights of refugees, he will be seen as a hero. In the Middle Ages people would have thought he had gone bonkers. Nobody in twelfth-century England knew what human rights were. You want to travel to the Middle East and risk your life not in order to kill Muslims, but to protect one group of Muslims from another? You must be out of your mind. That’s how history unfolds. People weave a web of meaning, believe in it with all their heart, but sooner or later the web unravels, and when we look back we cannot understand how anybody could have taken it seriously.

Many people argue that the great building projects of ancient Egypt – all the dams and reservoirs and pyramids – must have been built by aliens from outer space. How else could a culture lacking even wheels and iron accomplish such wonders? The truth is very different. Egyptians built Lake Fayum and the pyramids not thanks to extraterrestrial help, but thanks to superb organisational skills. Relying on thousands of literate bureaucrats, pharaoh recruited tens of thousands of labourers and enough food to maintain them for years on end. When tens of thousands of labourers cooperate for several decades, they can build an artificial lake or a pyramid even with stone tools. Pharaoh himself hardly lifted a finger, of course. He didn’t collect taxes himself, he didn’t draw any architectural plans, and he certainly never picked up a shovel. But the Egyptians believed that only prayers to the living-god pharaoh and to his heavenly patron Sobek could save the Nile Valley from devastating floods and droughts. They were right. Pharaoh and Sobek were imaginary entities that did nothing to raise or lower the Nile water level, but when millions of people believed in pharaoh and Sobek and therefore cooperated to build dams and dig canals, floods and droughts became rare. Compared to the Sumerian gods, not to mention the Stone Age spirits, the gods of ancient Egypt were truly powerful entities that founded cities, raised armies and controlled the lives of millions of humans, cows and crocodiles. It may sound strange to credit imaginary entities with building or controlling things. But nowadays we habitually say that the United States built the first nuclear bomb, that China built the Three Gorges Dam or that Google is building an autonomous car. Why not say, then, that pharaoh built a reservoir and Sobek dug a canal?

Consequently, in 1958 the Chinese government was told that annual grain production was 50 per cent more than it actually was. Believing the reports, the government sold millions of tons of rice to foreign countries in exchange for weapons and heavy machinery, assuming that enough was left to feed the Chinese population. The result was the worst famine in history and the death of tens of millions of Chinese.

In practice, the power of human cooperation networks rests on a delicate balance between truth and fiction. If you distort reality too much, it will weaken you, and you will not be able to compete against more clear-sighted rivals. On the other hand, you cannot organise masses of people effectively without relying on some fictional myths. So if you stick to pure reality, without mixing any fiction with it, few people would follow you.

How do you know if an entity is real? Very simple – just ask yourself, ‘Can it suffer?’ When people burn down the temple of Zeus, Zeus doesn’t suffer. When the euro loses its value, the euro doesn’t suffer. When a bank goes bankrupt, the bank doesn’t suffer. When a country suffers a defeat in war, the country doesn’t really suffer. It’s just a metaphor. In contrast, when a soldier is wounded in battle, he really does suffer. When a famished peasant has nothing to eat, she suffers. When a cow is separated from her newborn calf, she suffers. This is reality. Of course suffering might well be caused by our belief in fictions. For example, belief in national and religious myths might cause the outbreak of war, in which millions lose their homes, their limbs and even their lives. The cause of war is fictional, but the suffering is 100 per cent real. This is exactly why we should strive to distinguish fiction from reality. Fiction isn’t bad. It is vital. Without commonly accepted stories about things like money, states or corporations, no complex human society can function. We can’t play football unless everyone believes in the same made-up rules, and we can’t enjoy the benefits of markets and courts without similar make-believe stories. But the stories are just tools. They should not become our goals or our yardsticks. When we forget that they are mere fiction, we lose touch with reality. Then we begin entire wars ‘to make a lot of money for the corporation’ or ‘to protect the national interest’. Corporations, money and nations exist only in our imagination. We invented them to serve us; how come we find ourselves sacrificing our lives in their service?

Why label such a voyage ‘spiritual’? This is a legacy from ancient dualist religions that believed in the existence of two gods, one good and one evil. According to dualism, the good god created pure and everlasting souls that lived in a wonderful world of spirit. However, the bad god – sometimes named Satan – created another world, made of matter. Satan didn’t know how to make his creation last, hence in the world of matter everything rots and disintegrates. In order to breathe life into his defective creation, Satan tempted souls from the pure world of spirit, and locked them up inside material bodies. That’s what humans are – a good spiritual soul trapped inside an evil material body. Since the soul’s prison – the body – decays and eventually dies, Satan ceaselessly tempts the soul with bodily delights, and above all with food, sex and power. When the body disintegrates and the soul has a chance to escape back to the spiritual world, its craving for bodily pleasures draws it back inside some new material body. The soul thus transmigrates from body to body, wasting its days in pursuit of food, sex and power. Dualism instructs people to break these material shackles and undertake a journey back to the spiritual world, which is totally unfamiliar to us, but is our true home. During this quest we must reject all material temptations and deals. Due to this dualist legacy, every journey on which we doubt the conventions and deals of the mundane world and walk towards an unknown destination is called ‘a spiritual journey’.

Japan’s prime minister, the nationalist Shinzō Abe, came to office in 2012 pledging to jolt the Japanese economy out of two decades of stagnation. His aggressive and somewhat unusual measures to achieve this have been nicknamed Abenomics. Meanwhile in neighbouring China the Communist Party still pays lip service to traditional Marxist–Leninist ideals, but in practice it is guided by Deng Xiaoping’s famous maxims that ‘development is the only hard truth’ and that ‘it doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white, so long as it catches mice’. Which means, in plain language: do anything it takes to promote economic growth, even if Marx and Lenin wouldn’t have been happy with it.

The humanist focus on feelings and experiences, rather than deeds, transformed art. Wordsworth, Dostoevsky, Dickens and Zola cared little for brave knights and derring-do, and instead described how ordinary people and housewives felt. Some people believe that Joyce’s Ulysses represents the apogee of this modern focus on the inner life rather than external actions – in 260,000 words Joyce describes a single day in the life of the Dubliners Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, who over the course of the day do . . . well, nothing much at all.

This is what the Tin Man does in The Wizard of Oz. He walks along the yellow brick road with Dorothy and her friends, hoping that when they get to Oz, the great wizard will give him a heart, while the Scarecrow wants a brain and the Lion wants courage. At the end of their journey they discover that the great wizard is a charlatan, and he can’t give them any of these things. But they discover something far more important: everything they wish for is already within themselves. There is no need of some godlike wizard in order to obtain sensitivity, wisdom or bravery. You just need to follow the yellow brick road, and open yourself to whatever experiences come your way. Exactly the same lesson is learned by Captain Kirk and Captain Jean-Luc Picard as they travel the galaxy in the starship Enterprise, by Huckleberry Finn and Jim as they sail down the Mississippi, by Wyatt and Billy as they ride their Harley-Davidsons in Easy Rider, and by countless other characters in myriad other road movies who leave their home town in Pennsylvania (or perhaps New South Wales), travel in an old convertible (or perhaps a bus), pass through various life-changing experiences, get in touch with themselves, talk about their feelings, and eventually reach San Francisco (or perhaps Alice Springs) as better and wiser individuals.

That’s why socialists discourage self-exploration, and advocate the establishment of strong collective institutions – such as socialist parties and trade unions – that aim to decipher the world for us. Whereas in liberal politics the voter knows best, and in liberal economics the customer is always right, in socialist politics the party knows best, and in socialist economics the trade union is always right. Authority and meaning still come from human experience – both the party and the trade union are composed of people and work to alleviate human misery – yet individuals must listen to the party and the trade union rather than to their personal feelings.

Evolutionary humanism has a different solution to the problem of conflicting human experiences. Rooting itself in the firm ground of Darwinian evolutionary theory, it says that conflict is something to applaud rather than lament. Conflict is the raw material of natural selection, which pushes evolution forward. Some humans are simply superior to others, and when human experiences collide, the fittest humans should steamroll everyone else. The same logic that drives humankind to exterminate wild wolves and to ruthlessly exploit domesticated sheep also mandates the oppression of inferior humans by their superiors. It’s a good thing that Europeans conquer Africans and that shrewd businessmen drive the dim-witted to bankruptcy. If we follow this evolutionary logic, humankind will gradually become stronger and fitter, eventually giving rise to superhumans. Evolution didn’t stop with Homo sapiens – there is still a long way to go. However, if in the name of human rights or human equality we emasculate the fittest humans, it will prevent the rise of the superman, and may even cause the degeneration and extinction of Homo sapiens.

Adolf Hitler too was changed and enlightened by his war experiences. In Mein Kampf, he tells how shortly after his unit reached the front line, the soldiers’ initial enthusiasm turned into fear, against which each soldier had to wage a relentless inner war, straining every nerve to avoid being overwhelmed by it. Hitler says that he won this inner war by the winter of 1915/16. ‘At last,’ he writes, ‘my will was undisputed master . . . I was now calm and determined. And this was enduring. Now Fate could bring on the ultimate tests without my nerves shattering or my reason failing.’11 The experience of war revealed to Hitler the truth about the world: it is a jungle run by the remorseless laws of natural selection. Those who refuse to recognise this truth cannot survive. If you wish to succeed, you must not only understand the laws of the jungle, but embrace them joyfully. It should be stressed that just like the anti-war liberal artists, Hitler too sanctified the experience of ordinary soldiers. Indeed, Hitler’s political career is one of the best examples we have for the immense authority accorded to the personal experience of common people in twentieth-century politics. Hitler wasn’t a senior officer – in four years of war, he rose no higher than the rank of corporal. He had no formal education, no professional skills and no political background. He wasn’t a successful businessman or a union activist, he didn’t have friends or relatives in high places, or any money to speak of. At first, he didn’t even have German citizenship. He was a penniless immigrant. When Hitler appealed to the German voters and asked for their trust, he could muster only one argument in his favour: his experiences in the trenches had taught him what you can never learn at university, at general headquarters or at a government ministry. People followed him, and voted for him, because they identified with him, and because they too believed that the world is a jungle, and that what doesn’t kill us only makes us stronger. Whereas liberalism merged with the milder versions of nationalism to protect the unique experiences of each human community, evolutionary humanists such as Hitler identified particular nations as the engines of human progress, and concluded that these nations ought to bludgeon or even exterminate anyone standing in their way. It should be remembered, though, that Hitler and the Nazis represent only one extreme version of evolutionary humanism. Just as Stalin’s gulags do not automatically nullify every socialist idea and argument, so too the horrors of Nazism should not blind us to whatever insights evolutionary humanism might offer.

In the 1960s and 1970s the word ‘liberal’ became a term of abuse in many Western universities. North America and western Europe experienced growing social unrest, as radical left-wing movements strove to undermine the liberal order. Students in Paris, London, Rome and the People’s Republic of Berkeley thumbed through Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book, and hung Che Guevara’s heroic portrait over their beds. In 1968 the wave crested with the outbreak of protests and riots all over the Western world. Mexican security forces killed dozens of students in the notorious Tlatelolco Massacre, students in Rome fought the Italian police in the so-called Battle of Valle Giulia, and the assassination of Martin Luther King sparked days of riots and protests in more than a hundred American cities. In May students took over the streets of Paris, President de Gaulle fled to a French military base in Germany, and well-to-do French citizens trembled in their beds, having guillotine nightmares. By 1970 the world contained 130 independent countries, but only thirty of these were liberal democracies, most of which were crammed into the north-western corner of Europe. India was the only important Third World country that committed to the liberal path after securing its independence, but even India distanced itself from the Western bloc, and leaned towards the Soviets. In 1975 the liberal camp suffered its most humiliating defeat of all: the Vietnam War ended with the North Vietnamese David overcoming the American Goliath. In quick succession communism took over South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. On 17 April 1975 the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, fell to the Khmer Rouge. Two weeks later, people all over the world watched as helicopters evacuated the last Yankees from the rooftop of the American Embassy in Saigon.

And then everything changed. Liberal democracy crawled out of history’s dustbin, cleaned itself up and conquered the world. The supermarket proved to be far stronger than the gulag. The blitzkrieg began in southern Europe, where the authoritarian regimes in Greece, Spain and Portugal collapsed, giving way to democratic governments. In 1977 Indira Gandhi ended the Emergency, re-establishing democracy in India. During the 1980s military dictatorships in East Asia and Latin America were replaced by democratic governments in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Taiwan and South Korea. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the liberal wave turned into a veritable tsunami, sweeping away the mighty Soviet Empire, and raising expectations of the coming end of history. After decades of defeats and setbacks, liberalism won a decisive victory in the Cold War, emerging triumphant from the humanist wars of religion, albeit a bit worse for wear.

很显然，这颗行星非常、非常古老。 福特望着在脚下移动的灰色地貌，不禁泛起一阵怀疑。这颗星球所经历的时间太过漫长，搅得他心头阵阵不安，他能感觉到时间犹如实物般的存在。福特清清嗓子。 “呃，即便假设它就是……” “肯定是。”赞法德说。 “但实际上却不是，”福特继续道，“你又打算怎么样呢？这里啥也没有。” “地表上啥也没有。”赞法德说。 “好吧好吧，假设的确有什么，我想你也不纯粹是为了产业考古而来的吧。你到底在找什么？” 赞法德的一个脑袋别开视线，另一个脑袋连忙跟着去看前一个脑袋在瞅什么，但前一个脑袋根本没在认真看任何东西。 “好吧，”赞法德轻描淡写地说，“一部分是好奇心，一部分是寻求冒险的感觉，但大部分我觉得是名声和金钱……” 福特向他投去尖锐的视线。他有一种强烈的感觉，赞法德根本不清楚他为啥来这儿。 “知道吗？我非常不喜欢这颗星球的样子。”翠莉安打了个寒颤。 “啊哈，别在意，”赞法德说，“旧银河帝国的半数财富就存放在这儿的什么地方，它花得起钱让自己显得如此寒酸。” 胡扯，福特心想。即便假设这里曾是某个古老文明在化为尘埃前的家园，即便假设了许许多多非常不可能的事情，以任何方式藏在这里某个地方的巨量财富到了今天也不可能存有任何意义了。他耸耸肩。 “我觉得这就是一颗已经死了的行星。”他说。 “这悬念都快弄死我了。”亚瑟烦躁地说。 现如今，压力和紧张在银河系的各个地区都成了严重的社会问题，为了使得情况不再继续恶化下去，故而决定提前泄露以下事实。 眼前所见的这颗行星其实的确是传说中的玛格里西亚。 不用多久，古老的自动防御系统就将发射致命的导弹，但造成的损害不过是打破了三个咖啡杯和一个老鼠笼子，在某人的前臂留下了淤青，以及一盆牵牛花和一条无辜的抹香鲸不合时宜的创生和突如其来的死亡。 为了保留几分神秘感觉，暂时先不公布淤青到底位于谁的前臂上。这项事实可以很好地构成悬念主体，因为反正也没什么紧要的。

不，等一等……有些话我得跟你说清楚，”赞法德说，“我从来率性而为。有了想做什么事的念头，再一想，嘿，干吗不呢？我就去做了。我觉得我能当上银河系总统，我就当上了银河系总统，简单得很。我决定偷走这艘船。我决定去寻找玛格里西亚，然后不就这么发生了吗？是的，我总要制订最像样的行事计划；没错，计划每次都能成功。就仿佛拥有一张银河信用卡，虽然你从不付账单，但这张卡总能刷得下去。无论何时，只要我停下来思考——我为什么想做某件事情呢？——我是怎么制订出行事计划的呢？——就会有非常强烈的欲望让我别去多想。就好比现在。跟你谈论这些花了我很大力气。”

银辟法斯特”原文为Slartibartfast，第一部分与slut（淫贱）谐音，第二部分与butt（屁股）谐音。作者最初给此角色起名为Phartiphukborlz，三个部分分别与fart（放屁）、fuck（性交）和balls（卵蛋）谐音，后来为了适合BBC电台播出而修改为Slartibartfast。作者的意图是要起一个“够粗鲁又难以打字的名字”（The rude name that is hard to type）。——译者

有个道理很重要也很普遍，那就是事情往往和表面上看起来的不一样。举例来说，在名叫地球的这颗行星上，人类总是认为他们比海豚聪明，因为人类的成就众多——轮子了，纽约了，战争了，等等等等——而海豚从头到尾却只在水里游来游去，享受美好时光。但是反过来，海豚也始终相信它们比人类要聪明得多——原因则完全相同。

“地球人，你所居住的那颗星球是老鼠定制、付款并主宰的。被毁灭的时候，它距离完成制造它的目标仅仅只有五分钟了，结果我们不得不重新再造一个。” 只有一个词语留在了亚瑟的脑子里。 “老鼠？”他说。 “没错，地球人。” “呃，不好意思，我们讨论的不会是那种白颜色、毛茸茸的小生物吧？依恋乳酪，在六十年代早期的肥皂剧里经常把女人吓得站在桌子上尖叫。” 银辟法斯特很有礼貌地清了清嗓子。 “地球人，”他说，“有时候很难跟上你的语言模式。不记得我在玛格里西亚的内部睡了五百万年吗？我非常不熟悉你所说的六十年代早期肥皂剧。你称之为老鼠的这种生物，你要明白，它们的实质和外表很不一样。它们乃是拥有超级智慧的巨大泛维度存在物伸入我们这个维度的突出体。什么爱吃乳酪了，吱吱叫了，全都是幌子而已。” 老人暂停片刻，怜悯地皱起眉头，继续说了下去。“还有，真是抱歉，它们一直在拿你们做实验。”

与生命相关的问题当然有很多，其中最流行的几个分别是：人为何要出生？又为何要死去？从生到死之间，人为何要把那么多的时间耗费在佩戴电子表上？ 许多许多百万年以前，一个拥有超级智慧的泛维度存在物种族（在其所处的泛维度宇宙中，他们的肉体呈现形式与我们并无什么不同）受够了因生命意义引发的无休无止的争吵，如此争吵经常打断他们最喜爱的消遣运动：獾式超级板球（这是一种很有趣的游戏，内容是突然毫无理由地殴击他人，然后赶紧逃跑）。因此，他们决定坐下来一劳永逸地解决这个问题。 他们为此自行建造了一台卓绝的超级电脑，这台电脑聪明得无以复加，连数据阵列都还没有连接完毕的时候，它就从“我思故我在”开始了思考，到还没有人想到要断电的时候，它已经推导出了八宝饭和所得税的存在。

“四十二！”鲁恩夸尔吼叫道，“你花了七百五十万年计算，只拿得出这么一个答案？” “我非常详尽地验算过了，”电脑说，“这确实就是答案。我想问题在于——我跟二位实话实说——在于你们其实没弄明白问题究竟是什么。” “不就是那个最伟大的问题吗？关于生命、宇宙及一切的终极问题！”鲁恩夸尔咆哮起来。 “是的，”深思的语气显得他对别人的愚蠢极为宽容，“但这个问题究竟是什么呢？” 两人瞪着电脑，继而面面相觑，迟滞而茫然的寂静渐渐笼罩住了他们。 “呃，你知道的，就是一切……一切……”佛奇格毫无底气地说。 “没错！”深思说，“一旦你们确切明白了那个问题究竟代表着什么，就会理解这个答案是什么意思。” “喔，了不起啊！”佛奇格嘟囔道，把笔记簿扔到旁边，擦掉一小滴眼泪。 “好吧，好吧，”鲁恩夸尔说，“你就不能行行好，告诉我们那问题到底是什么吗？” “那个终极问题？” “是的！” “关于生命、宇宙以及一切的终极问题？” “是的！” 深思琢磨了一阵子。 “有难度。”他说。 “但你做得到，对吧？”鲁恩夸尔嘶喊道。 深思又琢磨了很长一阵子。 最后，他坚定不移地说：“不行。” 两个人绝望地瘫软在了椅子里。 “但我能告诉你们谁做得到。”深思说。 两人猛然抬头。 “谁？告诉我们！” 突然，亚瑟感到他看似并不存在的头皮一阵悚然，他发觉自己正缓慢而不可抗拒地移向屏幕，但按照他的估计，这只是因为拍摄者戏剧性地拉近了镜头而已。 “我指的不是其他东西，而就是那在我以后来的电脑[1]，”深思吟诵道，他又用起了熟悉的演说家口吻，“我连替它计算最基本的工作参数也不配——但我将为你们设计这台电脑。这台电脑能计算出终极答案的问题，这台电脑拥有无限精妙的复杂性，以至于有机生命本身亦将构成其操作矩阵的一部分。你们本人将获得新的外形，到电脑中去指引它完成一千万年的程序运行！是的！我将为你们设计这台电脑。我还将为你们给它起名。这台电脑将被称为……地球！”

闲言碎语或会害人丧命，这是众所周知的道理，但这个问题的真实内涵却少有人知。 举例来说，就在亚瑟说“我的生活方式似乎出了极大的问题”这句话的时候，时空连续体的基础结构上出现了一个奇异的虫洞，把这句话在时间上传回非常、非常遥远的过去，在空间上跨越了近乎于无限远的距离，来到远方的另外一个银河系，这里居住着许多奇异的好战生物，可怕的星际战争此刻正一触即发。 敌对双方的领导人正在最后一次会面。 恐怖的寂静笼罩着会议桌，乌尔赫格斯的司令官身穿镶珠宝的黑色战斗短裤，形象光彩夺目，漠然瞪视蹲伏在对面的格加戈翁特领导者，那家伙周围萦绕着气味芬芳的绿色蒸汽；上百万艘造型圆滑、武装到了牙齿的星际巡洋舰严阵以待，只待他一声令下就将释放出致死的电子波束，他要那只可鄙的野兽收回对他母亲的侮辱话语。 那家伙在令人恶心的沸腾蒸汽中动了动身体，就在这个时刻，“我的生活方式似乎出了极大的问题”这句话飘荡在了会议桌上空。 很不幸的是，在乌尔赫格斯语言中，这句话是你能想象得到的最可怖的挑衅语，随之而来的只能是绵延数世纪的殊死战争。 最后，他们的银河系经受了几千年蹂躏之后，大家终于意识到这整件事情乃是一个可怕的错误，两个敌对的舰队搁置了还剩下的几项分歧，对我们的银河系发起联合袭击——他们很确切地辨识出，那句极为冒犯尊严的侮辱话语出自这里。 又过了几千年，这支无敌舰队穿过茫茫太空，终于呼啸着扑向他们碰到的第一颗行星——凑巧就是地球——由于尺寸的计算出了极大失误，整个舰队都在偶然间被一条小狗吞进了肚子。 研究宇宙历史中因果复杂交互作用的人声称，这类事情总会发生，我们无力阻止。 “生活，就是这样。”他们说。

无论是谁，只要想在极度复杂且令人困惑的宇宙中搞清楚生命有何意义，《银河系搭车客指南》就是他们不可或缺的好伙伴，因为这本书尽管不可能在所有事情上提供帮助或有益的情报，至少也能向你表明一种态度：即便有什么地方不准确，那也是“权威性的”不准确。若是遇到了巨大的分歧，出错的也肯定是现实。 这就是告示的要点所在，原话如此：“《指南》永远正确，现实偶尔出错。” 这个思路引发了一些有趣的后果。举例来说，有人曾因为从字面上理解特拉尔星球的条目（书里说的是“贪婪虫叨叨兽经常为来访旅客制作美味餐点”，而不是“贪婪虫叨叨兽经常用来访旅客制作美味餐点”）而丧命，其家属因此控告《指南》编辑部，他们辩解说前一个句子在美学上更加让人愉快，因此传召了一位广受尊重的诗人，让他宣誓作证说美即真理，真理即美，希望由此证明有罪的一方是生命本身，因为生命既不美也不真。几位法官达成共识，在接下来的动情陈词中宣布生命藐视法庭，随即将在场众人的生命没收充公，然后出门去享受一晚愉快的超高尔夫球。

绝对全景漩涡根据物质分析外推原理获取整个宇宙的图景。 试解释如下：宇宙里的每一块物质都以某种方式被宇宙中的另一块物质影响，因此在理论上说就有可能从——比方说——一小块精灵蛋糕[1]开始，外推得到整个宇宙——每一颗恒星，每一颗行星，它们的轨道、成分、经济和社会史。 发明绝对全景漩涡的人发明绝对全景漩涡基本上只是为了惹恼他的老婆。 特林·特拉古拉——这是发明者的名字——是梦想家、思想家、思辨哲学家[2]，或者，按照他老婆的说法，白痴。 她没完没了地唠叨他，说他花了多得不正常的时间仰望星空、研究安全别针的机械结构并对精灵蛋糕碎屑做光谱分析。 “总得知道个轻重缓急吧！”她这么说，有时候单在一天内就要说三十八遍。 因此，他建造了绝对全景漩涡——得让她开开眼。 他把从一小块精灵蛋糕外推出的整个现实嵌在一头，把老婆塞进另外一头：这样的话，他一启动机器，他老婆就会有一瞬间瞥见整个无限宇宙和自己与宇宙的比例关系。 结果让特林·特拉古拉惊恐不已：巨大的震撼彻底摧毁了他老婆的大脑；但也让他心满意足，因为他发觉自己确凿证明了一件事情：要是生命还想存在于如此尺度的宇宙之中，那生命体就无论如何也不该拥有感知比例的能力[3]。

it is meaningless to ask whether I choose my desires deterministically, randomly or freely. It may sound extremely complicated, but it is surprisingly easy to test this idea. Next time a thought pops up in your mind, stop and ask yourself: ‘Why did I think this particular thought? Did I decide a minute ago to think this thought, and only then did I think it? Or did it just arise in my mind, without my permission or instruction? If I am indeed the master of my thoughts and decisions, can I decide not to think about anything at all for the next sixty seconds?’ Just try, and see what happens. Doubting free will is not just a philosophical exercise. It has practical implications. If organisms indeed lack free will, it implies we could manipulate and even control their desires using drugs, genetic engineering or direct brain stimulation. If you want to see philosophy in action, pay a visit to a robo-rat laboratory. A robo-rat is a run-of-the-mill rat with a twist: scientists have implanted electrodes into the sensory and reward areas in the rat’s brain. This enables the scientists to manoeuvre the rat by remote control. After short training sessions, researchers have managed not only to make the rats turn left or right, but also to climb ladders, sniff around garbage piles, and do things that rats normally dislike, such as jumping from great heights. Armies and corporations show keen interest in the robo-rats, hoping they could prove useful in many tasks and situations. For example, robo-rats could help detect survivors trapped under collapsed buildings, locate bombs and booby traps, and map underground tunnels and caves. Animal-welfare activists have voiced concern about the suffering such experiments inflict on the rats. Professor Sanjiv Talwar of the State University of New York, one of the leading robo-rat researchers, has dismissed these concerns, arguing that the rats actually enjoy the experiments. After all, explains Talwar, the rats ‘work for pleasure’ and when the electrodes stimulate the reward centre in their brain, ‘the rat feels Nirvana’.3 To the best of our understanding,

Each of us has a sophisticated system that throws away most of our experiences, keeps only a few choice samples, mixes them up with bits from movies we saw, novels we read, speeches we heard, and from our own daydreams, and weaves out of all that jumble a seemingly coherent story about who I am, where I came from and where I am going. This story tells me what to love, whom to hate and what to do with myself. This story may even cause me to sacrifice my life, if that’s what the plot requires. We all have our genre. Some people live a tragedy, others inhabit a never-ending religious drama, some approach life as if it were an action film, and not a few act as if in a comedy. But in the end, they are all just stories. What, then, is the meaning of life? Liberalism maintains that we shouldn’t expect an external entity to provide us with some readymade meaning. Rather, each individual voter, customer and viewer ought to use his or her free will in order to create meaning not just for his or her life, but for the entire universe. The life sciences undermine liberalism, arguing that the free individual is just a fictional tale concocted by an assembly of biochemical algorithms. Every moment, the biochemical mechanisms of the brain create a flash of experience, which immediately disappears. Then more flashes appear and fade, appear and fade, in quick succession. These momentary experiences do not add up to any enduring essence. The narrating self tries to impose order on this chaos by spinning a never-ending story, in which every such experience has its place, and hence every experience has some lasting meaning. But, as convincing and tempting as it may be, this story is a fiction. Medieval crusaders believed that God and heaven provided their lives with meaning. Modern liberals believe that individual free choices provide life with meaning. They are all equally delusional.

我必须跟阿道夫一样，把公务员看得非常轻贱。像这类观点，或者说立场上的统一，是我们友谊当中一个不可或缺的部分。如今，在了解到他对行政工作所抱有的强烈排斥情绪之后，我才明白，他为什么会更乐意把友情交给一个普通的家具装潢匠，而不是那些被溺爱的宠儿——他们从良好的家庭社会关系中得到庇护的保证，能够准确的预知未来的人生道路。而希特勒的情况与之恰恰相反，他的生活中总是充斥着诸多的不确定性因素。从积极的方面来看，还有一个事实似乎注定要让我成为阿道夫眼中的理想伙伴：我们彼此都认为，艺术是人间最美好的事物。当然，在那个时候，我们还不能用这么夸张的语言来表达我们的思想感情。但在实践中，我们都一直遵循这一原则，因为音乐早已成为了我生活中的决定性因素------在作坊工作只是为了谋生。对我朋友而言，艺术更是显得至关重要。他处事的极端方法，可怕的严肃情绪，还有永不停歇的活跃思维，都需要得到一种平衡。而只有艺术能够帮他做到这一点。

阿道夫带着饥饿，投身到一项真正的艺术当中。虽然他偶尔也能碰上打牙祭的机会，但不可否认的是，他在维也纳通常都没钱购买食物。即便有钱，他也更愿意空着肚皮，把钱拿去看戏。他缺少常人那种对生活娱乐的理解。他不抽烟也不喝酒，在维也纳，他只靠牛奶和面包度日。

当然，人们普遍都感觉他是一个十分严肃的人，尤其是在跟他接触不多的情况下。这种绝对的严肃，似乎遮蔽了希特勒的其他特点。青年时期的他同样如此。在处理问题的时候，他总是显得格外认真，这种表现与他十六七岁的年龄很不相称。他可以认真的去爱，去赞美，去恨，去鄙视。但有一样他无法做到，那就是对某件事情一笑置之。哪怕是针对他不感兴趣的事物，比如运动，这样一种现代社会的普遍现象，在他眼里都显得同等重要。他的问题总是层出不穷。不管遇到什么样的新问题，他都绝不会敷衍对待。要是在现实中没有找到答案，他就足不出户，花大量时间翻阅书籍，冥思苦想并对这个问题进行刨根究底。这种惊人的钻劲儿是他性格中最突出的品质。而其他年轻人的一些思想在他身上却难觅踪迹：得过且过；活在当下；“听其自然”的愉快态度。即便是年轻人正常的“越轨行为”他都无法容忍。说来奇怪，在他的思想中，这并不是一个年轻人该干的事情

In May 2014 Deep Knowledge Ventures – a Hong Kong venture-capital firm specialising in regenerative medicine – broke new ground by appointing an algorithm called VITAL to its board. VITAL makes investment recommendations by analysing huge amounts of data on the financial situation, clinical trials and intellectual property of prospective companies. Like the other five board members, the algorithm gets to vote on whether the firm makes an investment in a specific company or not. Examining VITAL’s record so far, it seems that it has already picked up one managerial vice: nepotism. It has recommended investing in companies that grant algorithms more authority. With VITAL’s blessing, Deep Knowledge Ventures has recently invested in Silico Medicine, which develops computer-assisted methods for drug research, and in Pathway Pharmaceuticals, which employs a platform called OncoFinder to select and rate personalised cancer therapies.17 As algorithms push humans out of the job market, wealth might become concentrated in the hands of the tiny elite that owns the all-powerful algorithms, creating unprecedented social inequality. Alternatively, the algorithms might not only manage businesses, but actually come to own them. At present, human law already recognises intersubjective entities like corporations and nations as ‘legal persons’. Though Toyota or Argentina has neither a body nor a mind, they are subject to international laws, they can own land and money, and they can sue and be sued in court. We might soon grant similar status to algorithms. An algorithm could then own a venture-capital fund without having to obey the wishes of any human master. If the algorithm makes the right decisions, it could accumulate a fortune, which it could then invest as it sees fit, perhaps buying your house and becoming your landlord. If you infringe on the algorithm’s legal rights – say, by not paying rent – the algorithm could hire lawyers and sue you in court. If such algorithms consistently outperform human fund managers, we might end up with an algorithmic upper class owning most of our planet. This may sound impossible, but before dismissing the idea, remember that most of our planet is already legally owned by non-human inter-subjective entities, namely nations and corporations. Indeed, 5,000 years ago much of Sumer was owned by imaginary gods such as Enki and Inanna. If gods can possess land and employ people, why not algorithms?

一只硕大的哺乳动物走近赞法德·毕博布鲁克斯的桌子，这又大又肥、肉乎乎的牛类四足动物长着水汪汪的大眼睛和一双小角，嘴唇上挂着的笑容堪称逢迎。 “晚上好，”动物重重地一屁股坐了下去，“我是特餐的主菜。能向各位介绍一下我身上最好吃的部位吗？”它哼哼唧唧地吭哧了几声，把后半身扭成更舒服的姿势，心平气和地看着他们。 迎接他的视线的是亚瑟和翠莉安的惊讶和困惑、福特·大老爷听天由命的耸肩和赞法德·毕博布鲁克斯赤裸裸的饥火。 “肩膀上的肉如何？”动物推荐道，“用白葡萄酒酱汁焖？” “呃，你的肩膀？”亚瑟惊恐地低声说。 “当然是我的肩膀了，先生，”动物惬意地哞哞道，“我才不推荐别家的肉呢。” 赞法德一跃而起，又是摸又是戳，欣赏起了动物的肩膀。 “后臀也相当不错，”动物喃喃说道。“我一直在锻炼这块肉，吃了许多谷物，所以那里的肌肉饱满而丰厚。”它发出醇厚甜软的咕哝声，又哼哼两下，开始咀嚼反刍的食物，随后把食物咽了回去。 “要么做个砂锅炖我？”它补充道。 “你是说这只动物真的想让我们吃了它？”翠莉安对福特耳语道。 “我？”福特眼神呆滞，“我啥也没说啊。” “这太恐怖了，”亚瑟叫道，“从没听说过这么让人反胃的事情。” “地球人，你有什么问题吗？”赞法德把注意力转向了动物硕大的后臀。 “我只是不想吃站在面前请我吃它的动物，”亚瑟说，“太没心没肺了。” “总比吃不想被你吃掉的动物强吧，”赞法德说。 “重点不在这儿，”亚瑟反驳道。他想了几秒钟。“好吧，”他说，“也许重点就在这儿。无所谓，反正现在我不想琢磨这个了。给我……呃……” 宇宙在周围疯狂地垂死挣扎。 “我想我就吃个蔬菜色拉吧，”他嘟囔道。 “考虑一下我的肝脏如何？”动物问他，“现在肯定非常醇厚鲜嫩了，我这几个月一直在强迫自己进食。” “蔬菜色拉，”亚瑟一字一顿地说。 “蔬菜色拉？”动物对亚瑟不满地翻个白眼。 “你难道想告诉我，”亚瑟说，“我不该吃蔬菜色拉？” “呃，”动物答道，“我知道有很多蔬菜非常明确地表达了这个意愿，为了彻底解决这个纠缠不清的难题，才有人培育了一种心甘情愿被吃掉并且能够明确无误地声明这一点的动物。喏，就是我了。” 动物费劲地微微鞠躬。

“非要说清楚的话，这里是蛙星星系B行星。” “但我们才刚离开那个地方啊，”赞法德还不服气，“我们离开那个地方，来到了宇宙尽头的餐馆。” “是的，先生，”侍者说，觉得他终于跑上了终点直道，而且步履如飞，“这里建筑在那个地方的废墟上。” “哦，”亚瑟高兴地说，“你是说我们做了时间旅行，但在空间上没有位移。” “半进化的猿猴，你都在胡扯什么啊，”赞法德打断他的话，“行行好爬树去吧，行吗？” 亚瑟不禁震怒。 “让你的两颗脑袋头撞头吧，四眼佬，”他建议赞法德。 “不，你错了，”侍者对赞法德说，“先生，你那只猴子倒是说对了。” 亚瑟愤怒得一时语塞，说不出任何连贯的句子。 “你在时间上向前跳跃了……我想应该是五千七百六十亿年，但在空间上还留在原来的地方，”侍者解释道。他开始微笑，心中涌起美妙的感觉——这场战斗他的赢面看似渺茫，但最终的胜利者仍旧是他。 “对了！”赞法德说，“我明白了。我吩咐电脑送我们去最近的地方吃饭，电脑不折不扣地执行了我的命令。去掉那五千七百六十亿年，我们根本没动过地方。干得漂亮。” 他们都同意这的确干得漂亮。

Techno-humanism agrees that Homo sapiens as we know it has run its historical course and will no longer be relevant in the future, but concludes that we should therefore use technology in order to create Homo deus – a much superior human model. Homo deus will retain some essential human features, but will also enjoy upgraded physical and mental abilities that will enable it to hold its own even against the most sophisticated non-conscious algorithms. Since intelligence is decoupling from consciousness, and since non-conscious intelligence is developing at breakneck speed, humans must actively upgrade their minds if they want to stay in the game.

today we have a very detailed (though far from perfect) map of the sub-normative mental spectrum. Simultaneously, scientists have studied the mental states of people considered to be healthy and normative. However, most scientific research about the human mind and the human experience has been conducted on people from Western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic (WEIRD) societies, who do not constitute a representative sample of humanity. The study of the human mind has so far assumed that Homo sapiens is Homer Simpson.

Dataism is most firmly entrenched in its two mother disciplines: computer science and biology. Of the two, biology is the more important. It was the biological embracement of Dataism that turned a limited breakthrough in computer science into a world-shattering cataclysm that may completely transform the very nature of life. You may not agree with the idea that organisms are algorithms, and that giraffes, tomatoes and human beings are just different methods for processing data. But you should know that this is current scientific dogma, and that it is changing our world beyond recognition.

free-market capitalism and state-controlled communism aren’t competing ideologies, ethical creeds or political institutions. At bottom, they are competing data-processing systems. Capitalism uses distributed processing, whereas communism relies on centralised processing. Capitalism processes data by directly connecting all producers and consumers to one another, and allowing them to exchange information freely and make decisions independently.

the stock exchange is the fastest and most efficient data-processing system humankind has so far created. Everyone is welcome to join, if not directly then through their banks or pension funds. The stock exchange runs the global economy, and takes into account everything that happens all over the planet – and even beyond it. Prices are influenced by successful scientific experiments, by political scandals in Japan, by volcanic eruptions in Iceland and even by irregular activities on the surface of the sun. In order for the system to run smoothly, as much information as possible needs to flow as freely as possible.

福特在刚和地球人接触时，发现地球人总是不停描述和复述一些非常明显的事实，例如“天气可真好啊”，或者“你个子可真高啊”，或者“没戏了，咱们死定了”，他就此琢磨出了好几套理论，此刻有必要复述一二。 他的第一套理论是：人类要是停止锻炼嘴唇，他们的嘴巴或许会自动封起来。 经过几个月的思考和观察，他又得出了第二套理论，也就是——“要是人类停止锻炼嘴唇的话，他们的大脑就会开始工作。” 事实上，他的第二套理论拿来描述卡克拉弗恩的贝尔塞布隆人倒是相当精确。 贝尔塞布隆人曾经让邻近种族产生过强烈的怨恨和不安全感，这是因为贝尔塞布隆人是银河系最开化、成就最高和——最重要的——最安静的文明。 然而，这却被广泛看作自以为是和挑衅，非常冒犯人，银河法庭因此决定惩罚他们，让贝尔塞布隆人染上最残忍的社会疾病：传心术。结果，为了不把哪怕最细微的念头传给五英里半径内的每一个人，他们现在必须扯着嗓门说话，没完没了地谈论天气、小小病痛、今天下午的比赛和卡克拉弗恩忽然间成了多么喧闹的一个地方。 另一个暂时屏蔽思维的办法是举办“灾难地带”乐队的演唱

In the early twenty-first century, politics is consequently bereft of grand visions. Government has become mere administration. It manages the country, but it no longer leads it. It makes sure teachers are paid on time and sewage systems don’t overflow, but it has no idea where the country will be in twenty years. To some extent, this is a very good thing. Given that some of the big political visions of the twentieth century led us to Auschwitz, Hiroshima and the Great Leap Forward, maybe we are better off in the hands of petty-minded bureaucrats. Mixing godlike technology with megalomaniac politics is a recipe for disaster. Many neo-liberal economists and political scientists argue that it is best to leave all the important decisions in the hands of the free market. They thereby give politicians the perfect excuse for inaction and ignorance, which are reinterpreted as profound wisdom. Politicians find it convenient to believe that the reason they don’t understand the world is that they need not understand it.

A few billionaires smoking cigars and drinking Scotch in some back room cannot possibly understand everything happening on the globe, let alone control it. Ruthless billionaires and small interest groups flourish in today’s chaotic world not because they read the map better than anyone else, but because they have very narrow aims. In a chaotic system, tunnel vision has its advantages, and the billionaires’ power is strictly proportional to their goals. If the world’s richest man would like to make another billion dollars he could easily game the system in order to achieve his goal. In contrast, if he would like to reduce global inequality or stop global warming, even he won’t be able to do it, because the system is far too complex.

If humankind is indeed a single data-processing system, what is its output? Dataists would say that its output will be the creation of a new and even more efficient data-processing system, called the Internet-of-All-Things. Once this mission is accomplished, Homo sapiens will vanish.

Humans are merely tools for creating the Internet-of-All-Things, which may eventually spread out from planet Earth to cover the whole galaxy and even the whole universe. This cosmic data-processing system would be like God. It will be everywhere and will control everything, and humans are destined to merge into it. This vision is reminiscent of some traditional religious visions. Thus Hindus believe that humans can and should merge into the universal soul of the cosmos – the atman. Christians believe that after death saints are filled by the infinite grace of God, whereas sinners cut themselves off from His presence. Indeed, in Silicon Valley the Dataist prophets consciously use traditional messianic language. For example, Ray Kurzweil’s book of prophecies is called The Singularity is Near, echoing John the Baptist’s cry: ‘the kingdom of heaven is near’ (Matthew 3:2). Dataists

To convince sceptics, Dataist missionaries repeatedly explain the immense benefits of the freedom of information. Just as capitalists believe that all good things depend on economic growth, so Dataists believe all good things – including economic growth – depend on the freedom of information. Why did the USA grow faster than the USSR? Because information flowed more freely in the USA. Why are Americans healthier, wealthier and happier than Iranians or Nigerians? Thanks to the freedom of information. So if we want to create a better world, the key is to set the data free.

I have a private car, but most of the time it sits idly in the car park. On a typical day, I enter my car at 8:04, and drive for half an hour to the university, where I park my car for the day. At 18:11 I come back to the car, drive half an hour back home, and that’s it. So I am using my car for just an hour a day. Why do I need to keep it for the other twenty-three hours? We can create a smart car-pool system, run by computer algorithms. The computer would know that I need to leave home at 8:04, and would route the nearest autonomous car to pick me up at that precise moment. After dropping me off at campus, it would be available for other uses instead of waiting in the car park. At 18:11 sharp, as I leave the university gate, another communal car would stop right in front of me, and take me home. In such a way, 50 million communal autonomous cars may replace 1 billion private cars, and we would also need far fewer roads, bridges, tunnels and parking spaces. Provided, of course, I renounce my privacy and allow the algorithms to always know where I am and where I want to go.

Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do. Twenty years ago Japanese tourists were a universal laughing stock because they always carried cameras and took pictures of everything in sight. Now everyone is doing it.

Throughout this book we have repeatedly asked what makes humans superior to other animals. Dataism has a new and simple answer. In themselves, human experiences are not superior at all to the experiences of wolves or elephants. One bit of data is as good as another. However, a human can write a poem about his experience and post it online, thereby enriching the global data-processing system. That makes his bits count. A wolf cannot do this. Hence all of the wolf’s experiences – as deep and complex as they may be – are worthless. No wonder we are so busy converting our experiences into data. It isn’t a question of trendiness. It is a question of survival. We must prove to ourselves and to the system that we still have value. And value lies not in having experiences, but in turning these experiences into free-flowing data.

Through the centuries on the rolling, grassy steppes of inner Asia, a warrior-herder carried a Spirit Banner, called a sulde, constructed by tying strands of hair from his best stallions to the shaft of a spear, just below its blade. Whenever he erected his camp, the warrior planted the Spirit Banner outside the entrance to proclaim his identity and to stand as his perpetual guardian. The Spirit Banner always remained in the open air beneath the Eternal Blue Sky that the Mongols worshiped. As the strands of hair blew and tossed in the nearly constant breeze of the steppe, they captured the power of the wind, the sky, and the sun, and the banner channeled this power from nature to the warrior. The wind in the horsehair inspired the warrior’s dreams and encouraged him to pursue his own destiny. The streaming and twisting of the horsehair in the wind beckoned the owner ever onward, luring him away from this spot to seek another, to find better pasture, to explore new opportunities and adventures, to create his own fate in his life in this world. The union between the man and his Spirit Banner grew so intertwined that when he died, the warrior’s spirit was said to reside forever in those tufts of horsehair. While the warrior lived, the horsehair banner carried his destiny; in death, it became his soul. The physical body was quickly abandoned to nature, but the soul lived on forever in those tufts of horsehair to inspire future generations.

Invariably an unplanned episode that started as an inconvenience ended by teaching me something new about the land or people. From riding nearly fifty miles in one day on a horse, I learned that the fifteen feet of silk tied tightly around the midriff actually kept the organs in place and prevented nausea. I also learned the importance of having dried yogurt in my pocket on such long treks, when there was no time to stop and cook a meal, as well as the practicality of the thick Mongol robe, called a deel, when riding on wooden saddles. An encounter with a wolf near the sacred mountain of Burkhan Khaldun became a blessing in the eyes of our companions rather than a threat, and countless episodes of getting lost or of breaking down brought new lessons about directions, navigation, and the patience of waiting until someone came along. Repeatedly, I learned how intimately the Mongols know their own world and how consistently and completely I could trust in their astute judgment, physical ability, and generous helpfulness.

I saw this look and heard this yearning everywhere in every state I visited. Nearly every American hungers to move.

We get hooked on the temporary rush or pleasure of a new experience, whatever that is, and then need to feed it the whole time. It doesn’t matter whether we feed it with food, drink, drugs, clothes, cars, relationships, work, or even the peace and quiet of the countryside. If we become dependent on it for our happiness, then we’re trapped. What happens when we can’t have it any more? And what happens when the excitement wears off?

But then what good is a car if you never take it anywhere? And it’s the same with meditation. The purpose of learning meditation is not so that you can spend your life sitting on your backside with your eyes closed, but to integrate that familiarity of awareness into other areas of your life. This is the integration. This means there are two different ways of using meditation. One is the “aspirin” approach, as I like to call it. We go out, lead busy lives, get stressed, need something to make us feel better afterward, and so do some meditation. Feeling better, refreshed, we then go out again, lead busy lives again, get stressed again, until we once more need something to make us feel better. There’s nothing wrong with this approach—in fact, you may well get considerable headspace from it, but it’s limited when compared to the second approach, which works to integrate that same quality of mind into the remainder of your life. The amount of time most people are able to dedicate toward the practice of seated meditation is but a fraction of the day. The great thing about applying mindfulness to the rest of the day is that it doesn’t require you to take any more time out, or to change your schedule in some way. In fact, you can just keep on doing exactly what you had planned. The difference is not in the activity, but the way in which you direct your mind while doing those things.

He began by asking me to imagine I was sitting on the side of a very busy road, with a blindfold around my head. “Now,” he said, “maybe you can hear the background noise, the cars whizzing by, but you can’t see them because you have your eyes covered, right?” I imagined myself sitting on the grass verge of a motorway and nodded in agreement. “So,” he went on, “before you start to meditate it can feel a bit like this. Because of all the background noise in the mind, all the thoughts, it means that even when you sit down to relax or go to bed at night, it still feels as though this noise continues, yes?” It was hard to argue with this, because it did indeed feel as though there was always a certain amount of background noise or restlessness in my mind, even when I was not consciously aware of the individual thoughts. “Now, imagine taking the blindfold off,” he continued. “For the first time you see the road, your mind, clearly. You see the cars racing by, the different colors, shapes and sizes. Maybe sometimes you are attracted by the sound of the cars, at other times more interested in their appearance. But this is what it’s like when you first take off the blindfold.” He started laughing to himself. “You know,” he said, “sometimes it’s at this point that people learning meditation say some very funny things. They start to blame their thoughts and feelings on the meditation. Can you believe it?” he asked mockingly. “They come and see me and say ‘I don’t know what’s happening, where all these thoughts are coming from. I never usually think this much, it must be the meditation making me think all the time,’ as if the meditation is somehow making their situation worse.” His laughter trailed off as he picked up the thread of his explanation. “So, the first thing to get straight is that meditation does not make you think! All it does is shine a big bright light on your mind so that you can see it more clearly. This bright light is awareness. You may not like what you see when you switch the light on, but it’s a clear and accurate reflection of how your mind behaves on a daily basis.”

My teacher continued by making a suggestion. “Here’s an idea—rather than running around in the traffic trying to control everything, why not try staying where you are for a moment? What happens then? What happens when you stay on the side of the road and just watch as the traffic goes past? Maybe it’s rush hour and the road’s full of cars, or maybe it’s the middle of the night and there are very few cars at all. It doesn’t really matter which it is. The point is to get used to ‘holding your seat’ on the side of the road and watching the traffic go by.” I found the idea of just watching the thoughts go by quite easy to imagine and for once I was actually in a hurry to get back to my meditation cushion. “When you start to approach your meditation in this way you’ll notice that your perspective changes,” he said. “In stepping back from the thoughts and feelings, there will be a sense of increased space. It might feel as if you are simply an observer, watching the thoughts, the traffic, go by. Sometimes you might forget,” he said, smiling knowingly, “and before you know it you’ll find yourself running down the road after a fancy-looking car. This is what happens when you experience a pleasant thought. You see it, get caught up in it, and end up chasing after the thought.” He was now laughing loudly as he imagined me chasing the cars. “But then all of a sudden, you’ll realize what you’re doing and, in that moment, you’ll have the opportunity to return to your seat at the side of the road. At other times, you might see some traffic coming that you don’t like the look of. Maybe it’s an old rusty car, an unpleasant thought, and you’ll no doubt rush out into the traffic to try and stop it. You might try to resist this feeling or thought for quite some time before you realize that you’re back in the road again. But the moment you do, in that moment, you have the opportunity to take up your position on the side of the road again.” He continued, now speaking more deliberately. “Over time, this will get easier. You won’t want to run out into the road quite so often and you’ll find it easier and easier to just sit and watch the thoughts go by. This is the process of meditation.” It’s worth taking some time to reflect on this analogy and as I sat there I considered what he’d said. It all made so much sense, at least theoretically. But there were a couple of points that didn’t feel right. If I was just sitting there as an observer to the thoughts, then who was doing the thinking? Surely I can’t be doing both at the same time? “Your thoughts are autonomous,” he explained. “Of course, if you want to think about something you can, you have that ability to reflect, to remember, or to project into the future and imagine how things might be. But what about the thoughts that just ‘pop’ into your mind when you sit to meditate, or when you’re walking down the street, or sitting at your desk trying to read a book? What about those thoughts? You didn’t bring those thoughts to mind, did you? They came to mind. One minute you’re reading a book and the next the thought of an old friend ‘pops’ into your mind. You haven’t thought of this friend for a long time and you made no conscious effort to bring him to mind and yet, all of a sudden, there he is!” This was definitely something I’d experienced a lot. I don’t know if it’s something that ever happens to you, but I’d often start reading a page of a book, only to reach the end and realize that not a word had gone in. Inevitably, somewhere along the way a thought had popped up and I’d become distracted, often without even being aware of it. “So,” he continued, “these thoughts that we try so hard to suppress, to get away from or to stop altogether, are pretty much just popping up whenever they feel like it, right? We like to think we control our minds, control the flow of thought, but if it was possible to do that then you wouldn’t have traveled halfway around the world for my advice.” He pointed at me, playfully, laughing. “In fact, if it were possible to control your thoughts then you’d never have any reason to get stressed at all. You’d simply block out all the unpleasant thoughts and live peacefully with all your happy thoughts.” I couldn’t believe how obvious it sounded when he explained it like that. It was almost as if I already knew it at some level, but had somehow forgotten to apply the idea to my life. “But what about productive thoughts?” I asked. “What about creative thoughts, ones that are necessary to solve problems?” “I’m not saying that all thinking is bad,” he said. “We need the ability to think in order to live. It’s the nature of mind to think. In the same way that the road was built for cars to journey on, so the mind exists to experience thoughts and feelings. So don’t make the mistake of thinking that all thoughts are bad. They’re not—we just need to know how to relate to them. What you need to ask yourself,” he continued, “is how much of your thinking is helpful, productive, and how much is unhelpful or unproductive. Only you know the answer to that. I’m assuming that because you’ve come all this way to see me, your thinking causes you problems at times, that maybe some of it is not so helpful?” There was no arguing with that. A great many of my thoughts fell into the “unhelpful and unproductive” category. “If you’re worried about losing these creative thoughts,” he gestured somewhat dismissively, “then where do you think they come from in the first place? Do those moments of inspiration come from cold, rational thinking, or do they arise from the stillness and the spaciousness of the mind? When the mind is always busy there’s no room for these thoughts to arise, so by training your mind you’ll actually make more space for these creative thoughts to arise. The point is, don’t be a slave to your mind. If you want to direct your mind and use it well, then good. But what use is the mind if it’s all over the place, with no sense of direction or stability?”

The reason this lesson was so important for me—and I hope will be for you—was that I’d always assumed I had to somehow create blue sky. I was under the impression that to experience headspace I needed to make something happen. The truth is, we don’t need to create anything. The blue sky is headspace, and it’s always there—or, rather, here. This changed everything for me. Meditation was no longer about trying to create an artificial state of mind, which I’d imagined headspace was. Neither was it about trying to keep all the clouds at bay. It was more a case of setting up a deckchair in the garden and watching as the clouds rolled by. Sometimes the blue sky would peek through the clouds, which felt nice. And, if I was able to sit there patiently and not get too engrossed in the clouds, then even more of the blue sky would start to appear. It was as if it happened on its own, with no help from me whatsoever. Watching the clouds in this way gave me perspective, a sense of space that I’d not known in my meditation before. More than that though, it gave me the confidence to sit and rest my mind in its natural state, not trying, not doing, just being.

“When you experience pleasant sensations in your practice, I want you to imagine sharing those feelings with other people,” he began. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s the pleasant sensation of a quiet mind, of a relaxed body or a comforting emotion; simply imagine you are giving it away, sharing it with your friends and family, the people you care about.” He continued. “It doesn’t require lots of thought and I still want you to focus on the breath, just counting the breaths as they pass. But, if you find yourself sitting there and you feel very good, then maintain this attitude of wanting to share it with others.” I couldn’t really see how this was going to help, but it sounded harmless enough and the sentiment was well meaning. “This next bit might be a little more challenging,” he said, smiling broadly. “When you experience discomfort in your meditation, whether it’s the restlessness of a busy mind, physical tension in the body, or a challenging emotion, I want you to imagine it’s the discomfort of the people you care about. It’s as if in an act of extraordinary generosity, you are sitting with their discomfort so they don’t have to.”

There is no reality in the danger. It’s just a very lonely, helpless feeling at first—a kind of desolate feeling. For this reason I took one companion on my journey—an old French gentleman poodle known as Charley. Actually his name is Charles le Chien. He was born in Bercy on the outskirts of Paris and trained in France, and while he knows a little poodle-English, he responds quickly only to commands in French. Otherwise he has to translate, and that slows him down. He is a very big poodle, of a color called bleu, and he is blue when he is clean.

As the day approached, my warm bed and comfortable house grew increasingly desirable and my dear wife incalculably precious. To give these up for three months for the terrors of the uncomfortable and unknown seemed crazy. I didn’t want to go. Something had to happen to forbid my going, but it didn’t. I could get sick, of course, but that was one of my main but secret reasons for going at all. During the previous winter I had become rather seriously ill with one of those carefully named difficulties which are the whispers of approaching age. When I came out of it I received the usual lecture about slowing up, losing weight, limiting the cholesterol intake. It happens to many men, and I think doctors have memorized the litany. It had happened to so many of my friends. The lecture ends, “Slow down. You’re not as young as you once were.” And I had seen so many begin to pack their lives in cotton wool, smother their impulses, hood their passions, and gradually retire from their manhood into a kind of spiritual and physical semi-invalidism. In this they are encouraged by wives and relatives, and it’s such a sweet trap.

You never know what people will want to drink. I ordered bourbon, scotch, gin, vermouth, vodka, a medium good brandy, aged applejack, and a case of beer. It seemed to me that those might take care of most situations. It was a big order for a little store. The owner was impressed. “Must be quite a party.” “No—it’s just traveling supplies.” He helped me to carry the cartons out and I opened Rocinante’s door. “You going in that?” “Sure.” “Where?” “All over.” And then I saw what I was to see so many times on the journey—a look of longing. “Lord! I wish I could go.” “Don’t you like it here?” “Sure. It’s all right, but I wish I could go.” “You don’t even know where I’m going.” “I don’t care. I’d like to go anywhere.”

I prefer to draw a curtain over my visit to Eagle-brook school. It can be imagined what effect Rocinante had on two hundred teen-age prisoners of education just settling down to serve their winter sentence. They visited my truck in droves, as many as fifteen at a time in the little cabin. And they looked courteous curses at me because I could go and they could not. My own son will probably never forgive me. Soon after I drove off, I stopped to make sure there were no stowaways.

But the experience taught me some lessons. One of the most important was that the emotion itself is often not the problem. It’s the way we react to it that causes the problem. For example, I feel angry and respond to it with more anger, stoking the coals, keeping the fire of anger burning. Or I feel worried and I start to feel worried that I feel worried. By stepping back and getting a little bit of perspective (something I could never have done without meditation) I was able to see the original emotion for what it was. And by simply being aware of it, it was as if it had its moment in the sun and was more willing to move on. So often we shut down when unpleasant feelings arise, we don’t want to feel them or be around them. But by reacting in this way we only give the emotion a greater sense of importance.

After all, it’s very difficult to separate thought and feeling. Do your thoughts define the way you feel? Or does the way you feel define your thoughts? Mindfulness is the willingness to rest in that natural state of awareness, resisting the temptation to judge whatever emotion comes up, and therefore neither opposing or getting carried away with a feeling. Meditation is simply the exercise that is going to give you the best conditions to practice being mindful of these emotions. And headspace is the result of applying this approach. Headspace does not mean being free from emotions, but rather existing in a place where you are at ease with whatever emotion is present.

A great way of cultivating this quality of gentle curiosity is to apply it to physical sensations within the body. Put the book down again and gently close your eyes as before. Starting at the top of the head, mentally scan through your body all the way down to the tips of your toes. The first time, do it quite quickly, taking about ten seconds to go from head to toe. The next time, take a bit longer, more like twenty seconds. And then do it one final time in a bit more detail, taking about thirty or forty seconds to do it. As you scan down through the body, notice which parts of it feel relaxed, comfortable and at ease, and which parts feel painful, uncomfortable or restricted in some way. Try to do it without any judgment or analysis, but more with a sense of just building up a picture of how the body feels right now. Don’t worry if thoughts distract you every now and then—each time you realize the mind has wandered off you can gently bring it back to wherever you left off.

All meditation, no matter which culture or tradition it comes from, how complicated it might appear, or what its purpose might be, relies on at least one of two essential components: concentration (usually the calming aspect) and clarity (usually the insight aspect). Sometimes the technique might incorporate just one of these components and at other times it will incorporate both. What tends to differentiate meditation techniques is more often the approach and the desired outcome.

At the first lighted roadside restaurant I pulled in and took my seat at a counter. The customers were folded over their coffee cups like ferns. A normal conversation is as follows: Waitress: “Same?” Customer: “Yep.” Waitress: “Cold enough for you?” Customer: “Yep.” (Ten minutes.) Waitress: “Refill?” Customer: “Yep.” This is a really talkative customer. Some reduce it to “Burp” and others do not answer at all. An early-morning waitress in New England leads a lonely life, but I soon learned that if I tried to inject life and gaiety into her job with a blithe remark she dropped her eyes and answered “Yep” or “Umph.” Still, I did feel that there was some kind of communication, but I can’t say what it was.

By steppe tradition, one of Yesugei’s brothers, who helped to kidnap Hoelun, should have taken her as a wife. Under the Mongol system of marriage, even one of Yesugei’s sons by his other wife, Sochigel, would have been an appropriate husband for her if he had been old enough to support the family. Mongol women often married much younger men in their deceased husband’s family because it gave the younger man the opportunity to have an experienced wife without having to pay an elaborate set of gifts to her family or to put in the years of hard bride-service.

Over the years I’ve heard many ways of describing this process, but I think the analogy I’m going to share with you now works best. Imagine a very still, clear pool of water. The water is quite deep, but very, very clear. Because the water’s so clear you can see absolutely everything at the bottom, making it appear shallow, even though it’s actually very deep. Now imagine sitting by the side of this water and throwing small pebbles into the middle. Start off quite slowly, just throwing them every now and then. You’ll notice that each new pebble creates a ripple on the surface of the water, and that it takes a little while for the water to then settle again. If you then throw another stone in before the water has completely settled, you create a new set of ripples that merges with the last. Now imagine throwing one stone after the next and seeing the entire surface of the water all stirred up at the same time. When the surface of the water looks like this, it’s almost impossible to see anything in the water at all, never mind anything at the bottom. This image reflects the surface of our minds in many ways—at least until we get around to training in some way. Each new thought, like a pebble being thrown into the water, creates ripples on the surface. We’ve got so used to throwing these pebbles, so used to the disturbance on the surface of the water, that we’ve forgotten what still water looks like. We know it’s not quite right as it is, but it’s as if the more we meddle with the mind trying to sort it out, the more ripples we create. It’s this restless quality of mind that creates the feeling of agitation when we sit down and find ourselves unable to relax.

Another way of describing meditation is to use the word “awareness.” So, if you’re unaware, then you are not meditating badly, you’re not meditating at all! It doesn’t matter whether you’re aware of lots of thoughts or of no thoughts. Nor does it matter whether you’re aware of pleasant feelings or unpleasant feelings. The skill is simply to be aware, that’s all.

Character, then, isn’t what we think it is or, rather, what we want it to be. It isn’t a stable, easily identifiable set of closely related traits, and it only seems that way because of a glitch in the way our brains are organized. Character is more like a bundle of habits and tendencies and interests, loosely bound together and dependent, at certain times, on circumstance and context. The reason that most of us seem to have a consistent character is that most of us are really good at controlling our environment. I have a lot of fun at dinner parties. As I result, I throw a lot of dinner parties and my friends see me there and think that I’m fun. But if I couldn’t have lots of dinner parties, if my friends instead tended to see me in lots of different situations over which I had little or no control—like, say, faced with four hostile youths in a filthy, broken down subway—they probably wouldn’t think of me as fun anymore.

“The figure of 150 seems to represent the maximum number of individuals with whom we can have a genuinely social relationship, the kind of relationship that goes with knowing who they are and how they relate to us. Putting it another way, it’s the number of people you would not feel embarrassed about joining uninvited for a drink if you happened to bump into them in a bar.” Dunbar has combed through the anthropological literature and found that the number 150 pops up again and again. For example, he looks at 21 different hunter gatherer societies for which we have solid historical evidence, from the Walbiri of Australia to the Tauade of New Guinea to the Ammassalik of Greenland to the Ona of Tierra del Fuego and found that the average number of people in their villages was 148.4. The same pattern holds true for military organization. “Over the years military planners have arrived at a rule of thumb which dictates that functional fighting units cannot be substantially larger than 200 men,” Dunbar writes. “This, I suspect, is not simply a matter of how the generals in the rear exercise control and coordination, because companies have remained obdurately stuck at this size despite all the advances in communications technology since the first world war. Rather, it is as though the planners have discovered, by trial and error over the centuries, that it is hard to get more than this number of men sufficiently familiar with each other so that they can work together as a functional unit.”

Gore doesn’t need formal management structures in its small plants—it doesn’t need the usual layers of middle and upper management—because in groups that small, informal personal relationships are more effective. “The pressure that comes to bear if we are not efficient at a plant, if we are not creating good earnings for the company, the peer pressure is unbelievable,” Jim Buckley, a longtime associate of the firm, told me. “This is what you get when you have small teams, where everybody knows everybody. Peer pressure is much more powerful than a concept of a boss. Many, many times more powerful. People want to live up to what is expected of them.”

Wegner argues that when people know each other well, they create an implicit joint memory system—a transactive memory system—which is based on an understanding about who is best suited to remember what kinds of things. “Relationship development is often understood as a process of mutual self disclosure,” he writes. “Although it is probably more romantic to cast this process as one of interpersonal revelation and acceptance, it can also be appreciated as a necessary precursor to transactive memory.”

The second is that if you’re going to learn how to meditate, then start slowly. There’s nothing wrong with taking just ten minutes to begin with. In fact, this is a long time if you’ve never done anything like this before. In the same way that the body needs to be trained to run marathons, so the mind needs to be trained to sit for longer periods of time. The story also illustrates the danger of waiting for the meditation to finish. It’s a common experience and it’s almost as though we think that by simply sitting there and not moving, we’re meditating, no matter what we’re doing with the mind. But this underlying sense of expectation, of waiting for something to happen, is a mind that is looking to the future, as opposed to a mind resting in the present. Think about it, how can there ever be a sense of ease resting in the present moment if the mind is hurriedly trying to get to a space and time in the future?

Take10—summary Getting ready: 1. Find a place to sit down comfortably, keeping a straight back. 2. Ensure you’ll be left undisturbed during your meditation (switch off your cell phone). 3. Set the timer for ten minutes. Checking-in: 1. Take 5 deep breaths, breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth and then gently close your eyes. 2. Focus on the physical sensation of the body on the chair and the feet on the floor. 3. Scan down through the body and notice which parts feel comfortable and relaxed, and which parts feel uncomfortable and tense. 4. Notice how you’re feeling—i.e. what sort of mood you’re in right now. Focusing the mind: 1. Notice where you feel the rising and falling sensation of the breath most strongly. 2. Notice how each breath feels, the rhythm of it—whether it’s long or short, deep or shallow, rough or smooth. 3. Gently count the breaths as you focus on the rising and falling sensation—1 with the rise and 2 with the fall, upward to a count of 10. 4. Repeat this cycle between 5 and 10 times, or for as long as you have time available. Finishing-off: 1. Let go of any focus at all, allowing the mind to be as busy or as still as it wants to be for about twenty seconds. 2. Bring the mind back to the sensation of the body on the chair and the feet on the floor. 3. Gently open your eyes and stand up when you feel ready.

This is what is meant by translation. What Mavens and Connectors and Salesmen do to an idea in order to make it contagious is to alter it in such a way that extraneous details are dropped and others are exaggerated so that the message itself comes to acquire a deeper meaning. If anyone wants to start an epidemic, then—whether it is of shoes or behavior or a piece of software—he or she has to somehow employ Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen in this very way: he or she has to find some person or some means to translate the message of the Innovators into something the rest of us can understand.

if there is difficulty and volatility in the world of the Tipping Point, there is a large measure of hopefulness as well. Merely by manipulating the size of a group, we can dramatically improve its receptivity to new ideas. By tinkering with the presentation of information, we can significantly improve its stickiness. Simply by finding and reaching those few special people who hold so much social power, we can shape the course of social epidemics. In the end, Tipping Points are a reaffirmation of the potential for change and the power of intelligent action. Look at the world around you. It may seem like an immovable, implacable place. It is not. With the slightest push—in just the right place—it can be tipped.

he still stuck to his preferred schedule of writing in the afternoons and staying out late drinking with friends. He felt he needed the nightly breaks to clear his head from literary labor that was exacting and exhausting. (Once, after two days of work yielded only two finished sentences, Joyce was asked if he had been seeking the right words. “No,” he replied, “I have the words already. What I am seeking is the perfect order of words in the sentences I have.”) Joyce finally finished the book in October 1921, after seven years of labor—“diversified,” as he put it, “by eight illnesses and nineteen changes of address, from Austria to Switzerland, to Italy, to France.” All in all, he wrote, “I calculate that I must have spent nearly 20,000 hours in writing Ulysses.”

I suddenly realized what it was. The monks were handing out ice-cream! Now before I get too carried away, just momentarily pause and consider what it would be like to eat the same curry and rice every day and never to have anything different. Okay, so now imagine someone serves you up a bowl of ice-cream. Pretty exciting, right? Well, I was excited—however ridiculous it sounds, I genuinely felt a rush of excitement. It was like being a child at a birthday party when the cake comes out. One by one the bowls were handed out to every monk and nun. I stared at the ice-cream. It was summertime, over 100 degrees … the clock was ticking. But of course nobody could begin until the gong had been struck. I grew quickly impatient, my concern for the ice-cream’s longevity far exceeding that which is appropriate for any human being to feel toward a frozen ball of cream and sugar. Of course, there was nothing wrong or even unusual in my reaction, but it would be fair to say that my levels of desire and craving at this point were nearing the far end of the scale. Then I saw what the hold-up was. The two monks who’d placed the ice-cream in front of us were now going around putting our regular bowls and spoons down on the table. I started to talk to myself. “It’s okay, the bowls are empty, this won’t take long, the ice-cream will last.” But by the time they finally reached our table I could see that what they were doing was pushing the bowls of ice-cream toward the middle of the table and placing the empty bowl and spoon in front of it. Behind them, two other monks were walking around with the pans of rice and curry, filling the bowls up. It was then that I realized what was happening: we would have to eat the curry before the ice-cream. Now in the privacy of my own home and with no speed restrictions I would have fancied my chances, but not here, not in the monastery. It would take almost an hour to eat the curry and rice and I was quite certain the discipline master would make sure of it. I felt a surge of anger, closely followed by lots of angry-looking thoughts. “This is ridiculous! It’s torture! What a waste of food! I thought Buddhism was supposed to be about kindness, there’s nothing kind about this! And what about that lovely man who’d spent his money on this ice-cream, had they given a moment’s thought to how he might feel?” Some of the thoughts went further still as I mechanically moved the fork in slow motion back and forth from the plate, looking longingly at the melting ball of ice-cream. I had no headspace and no sense of awareness. Far from being mindful, I was entirely absorbed in my own thoughts. In fact, I was so absorbed in my own thoughts that I couldn’t even see that in reality the real cause of anger was simply me not getting what I wanted. I guess you could call it attachment, wanting something so much that when you don’t get it you resist, you struggle. Well, I was struggling all right, no doubt about it. Funnily enough, people often get angry on my behalf when I tell them this story. But remember, I was staying at the monastery of my own free will and could get up and leave at any time. I was a willing participant in these situations and felt that I had something to learn from the experiences. It’s just that sometimes I got so caught up in my own thoughts and feelings that I temporarily forgot to be aware of this simple fact.

Then there’s Clif Bar, which was founded by a guy who, in 1990, seemed like the quintessential Berkeley free spirit—unmarried, thirty-three years old, living in a garage with his dog, his skis, his climbing equipment, a bike, and two trumpets of the type he’d been playing since the fifth grade. He drove a bucket-of-bolts 1976 Datsun and owned a wholesale bakery, Kali’s Sweets & Savories, with a friend. His passions were bike racing, rock climbing, and improvisational jazz. Those were still his passions fifteen years later, and he was running exactly the type of business you’d expect such a guy to have if he had somehow managed to grow one beyond his wildest dreams. If you visited its building on Fifth Street in the Berkeley flats, you would see numerous signs of the renovations and expansions that had been required over the years. In the main office area, you’d notice first the huge climbing wall, from which dolls—Cookie Monster, Po from Teletubbies, Piglet, Taz—were hanging to mark Clif Bar’s progress toward its sales goals. (Another wall was just for climbing.) Elsewhere in the building, you would find a gym, perhaps with a dance aerobics class in progress, and a sign-up sheet for the personal trainers, not to mention a massage room, an in-house hair salon, a meditation tent, a full bike repair shop, and a well-stocked game room. It all fit right in. A decade and a half after founding Clif Bar, Gary Erickson had changed a bit—he was married with three children, for one thing—but Berkeley was pretty much the same, just more prosperous. That could be said of Clif Bar as well. Everything that had characterized it in its early days was still there, just more of it and better organized. It had formalized its commitment to a sustainable environment, using certified organic ingredients in its products, organic cotton in its T-shirts, recycled paper in its publications, and as little energy as possible in its operations.

Study the fellow who is shuffling down there in mediocrity. He believes he is worth little, so he receives little. He believes he can’t do big things, and he doesn’t. He believes he is unimportant, so everything he does has an unimportant mark. As times goes by, lack of belief in himself shows through in the way the fellow talks, walks, acts. Unless he readjusts his thermostat forward, he shrinks, grows smaller and smaller, in his own estimation. And, since others see in us what we see in ourselves, he grows smaller in the estimation of the people around him.

Much lack of self-confidence can be traced directly to a mismanaged memory. Your brain is very much like a bank. Every day you make thought deposits in your “mind bank.” These thought deposits grow and become your memory When you settle down to think or when you face a problem, in effect you say to your memory bank, “What do I already know about this?”

Do this: in these moments when you’re alone with your thoughts—when you’re driving your car or eating alone—recall pleasant, positive experiences. Put good thoughts in your memory bank. This boosts confidence. It gives you that “I-sure-feel-good” feeling. It helps keep your body functioning right, too. Here is an excellent plan. Just before you go to sleep, deposit good thoughts in your memory bank. Count your blessings. Recall the many good things you have to be thankful for: your wife or husband, your children, your friends, your health. Recall the good things you saw people do today. Recall your little victories and accomplishments. Go over the reasons why you are glad to be alive. 2.

Action cures fear. Isolate your fear and then take constructive action. Inaction—doing nothing about a situation—strengthens fear and destroys confidence. Make a supreme effort to put only positive thoughts in your memory bank. Don’t let negative, self-deprecatory thoughts grow into mental monsters. Simply refuse to recall unpleasant events or situations. Put people in proper perspective. Remember, people are more alike, much more alike, than they are different. Get a balanced view of the other fellow. He is just another human being. And develop an understanding attitude. Many people will bark, but it’s a rare one who bites. Practice doing what your conscience tells you is right. This prevents a poisonous guilt complex from developing. Doing what’s right is a very practical rule for success. Make everything about you say, “I’m confident, really confident.” Practice these little techniques in your day-to-day activities: Be a front seater. Make eye contact. Walk 25 percent faster. Speak up. Smile big.

Don’t sell yourself short. Conquer the crime of self-deprecation. Concentrate on your assets. You’re better than you think you are. Use the big thinker’s vocabulary. Use big, bright, cheerful words. Use words that promise victory, hope, happiness, pleasure; avoid words that create unpleasant images of failure, defeat, grief. Stretch your vision. See what can be, not just what is. Practice adding value to things, to people, and to yourself. Get the big view of your job. Think, really think your present job is important. That next promotion depends mostly on how you think toward your present job. Think above trivial things. Focus your attention on big objectives. Before getting involved in a petty matter, ask yourself, “Is it really important?” Grow big by thinking big!

“Naturally,” she answered, “I worked hard, but just getting up early and working late isn’t responsible for the four stores. Most people in my business work hard. The main thing I attribute my success to is my self-styled ‘weekly improvement program.’” “A weekly improvement program? Sounds impressive. How does it work?” I asked. “Well, it really isn’t anything elaborate,” she continued, “it’s just a plan to help me do a better job as each week rolls around. “To keep my forward thinking on the track, I’ve divided my job into four elements: customers, employees, merchandise, and promotion. All during the week I make notes and jot down ideas as to how I can improve my business. “Then, every Monday evening, I set aside four hours to review the ideas I’ve jotted down and figure out how to put the solid ones to use in the business. “In this four-hour period I force myself to take a hard look at my operation. I don’t simply wish more customers would shop in my store. Instead I ask myself, ‘What can I do to attract more customers?’ ‘How can I develop regular, loyal customers?’”

The I-can-do-better philosophy works magic, When you ask yourself, “How can I do better?” your creative power is switched on and ways for doing things better suggest themselves. Here is a daily exercise that will help you discover and develop the power of the I-can-do-better attitude. Each day before you begin work, devote ten minutes to thinking “How can I do a better job today?” Ask, “What can I do today to encourage my employees?” “What special favor can I do for my customers?” “How can I increase my personal efficiency?” This exercise is simple. But it works. Try it, and you’ll find unlimited creative ways to win greater success.

The point is this: The way we think toward our jobs determines how our subordinates think toward their jobs. The job attitudes of our subordinates are direct reflections of our own job attitudes. It’s well to remember that our points of superiority—and weakness—show up in the behavior of those who report to us, just as a child reflects the attitudes of his parents.

Because big men do not laugh at big ideas. Or suppose you tell some average people you plan to own an expensive home, and they may laugh at you because they think it’s impossible. But tell your plan to a person already living in an expensive home, and he won’t be surprised. He knows it isn’t impossible, because he’s already done it. Remember: People who tell you it cannot be done almost always are unsuccessful people, are strictly average or mediocre at best in terms of accomplishment. The opinions of these people can be poison. Develop a defense against people who want to convince you that you can’t do it. Accept negative advice only as a challenge to prove that you can do it. Be extra, extra cautious about this: don’t let negative-thinking people—”negators”—destroy your plan to think yourself to success. Negators are everywhere, and they seem to delight in sabotaging the positive progress of others.

Broadcast good news about how you feel. Be an “I-feel-great” person. Just say “I feel great” at every possible opportunity, and you will feel better. By the same token, tell people, “I feel awful, just awful,” and you will feel worse. How we feel is, in large part, determined by how we think we feel. Remember, too, that other people want to be around alive, enthusiastic people. Being around complainers and half-dead people is uncomfortable.

F. H. wanted the company to pay him more and then he would produce more. But this is not how the system works. You don’t get a raise on the promise of better performance; you get a raise only by demonstrating better performance. You can’t harvest money unless you plant the seeds that grow money. And the seed of money is service. Put service first, and money takes care of itself.

1. Grow the “I’m activated” attitude. Results come in proportion to the enthusiasm invested. Three things to do to activate yourself are: Dig into it deeper. When you find yourself uninterested in something, dig in and learn more about it. This sets off enthusiasm. Life up everything about you: your smile, your handshake, your talk, even your walk. Act alive. Broadcast good news. No one ever accomplished anything positive telling bad news. 2. Grow the “You are important” attitude. People do more for you when you make them feel important. Remember to do these things: Show appreciation at every opportunity. Make people feel important. Call people by name. 3. Grow the “Service first” attitude, and watch money take care of itself. Make it a rule in everything you do: give people more than they expect to get.

Here are six ways to win friends by exercising just a little initiative: 1. Introduce yourself to others at every possible opportunity—at parties, meetings, on airplanes, at work, everywhere. 2. Be sure the other person gets your name straight. 3. Be sure you can pronounce the other person’s name the way he pronounces it. 4. Write down the other person’s name, and be mighty sure you have it spelled correctly; understandably people have a thing about the correct spelling of their own names! If possible, get their address and phone number, also. 5. Drop a personal note or make a phone call to the new friends you feel you want to know better. This is an important point. Most successful people follow through on new friends with a letter or a phone call. 6. And last but not least, say pleasant things to strangers. It warms you up and gets you ready for the task ahead. Putting these six rules to work is really thinking right about people. To be sure, it is not the way the average person thinks. Mr. “Average” never takes the initiative in making introductions. He waits for the other person to introduce himself first. Take the initiative. Be like the successful. Go out of your way to meet people. And don’t be timid. Don’t be afraid to be unusual. Find out who the other person is, and be sure he knows who you are.

Hundreds of my own little experiments have revealed this: The person who does the most talking and the person who is the most successful are rarely the same person. Almost without exception, the more successful the person, the more he practices conversation generosity, that is, he encourages the other person to talk about himself, his views, his accomplishments, his family, his job, his problems. Conversation generosity paves the way to greater success in two important ways: 1. Conversation generosity wins friends. 2. Conversation generosity helps you learn more about people. Remember this: the average person would rather talk about himself than anything else in this world. When you give him the chance, he likes you for it. Conversation generosity is the easiest, simplest, and surest way there is to win a friend. The second benefit of conversation generosity, learning more about other people, is important, too. As we said in Chapter 1, people are what we study in our success lab. The more we can learn about them, their thought processes, their strong and weak points, why they do what and as they do, the better equipped we are to influence them effectively, in the way that we want. Let me illustrate. A large New York advertising agency, like all advertising agencies, specializes of course in telling the public why it should buy the products it advertises. But this agency does something else, too. It requires its copywriters to spend one week each year behind counters so they can listen to what people say about the products they promote. Listening provides the clues these copywriters need to write better, more effective ads. Many progressive businesses conduct so-called terminal interviews with employees who are leaving. The reason is not to sell the employees on staying with the company but to find out why he is quitting. Then the company can bring about improvements in its employee relations. Listening pays off. Listening pays off for the salesman, too. Often people think of a good

2. Be a volunteer. Each of us has been in situations in which we wanted to volunteer for some activity but didn’t. Why? Because of fear. Not fear that we couldn’t accomplish the task, but rather fear of what our associates would say. The fear of being laughed at, of being called an eager beaver, of being accused of bucking for a raise holds many people back. It’s natural to want to belong, to be accepted, to have group approval. But ask yourself, “Which group do I want to have accept me: the group that laughs because it is secretly jealous or the group that is making progress by doing things?” The right choice is obvious. The volunteer stands out. He receives special attention. Most important of all, he gives himself an opportunity to show he has special ability and ambition by volunteering. By all means, volunteer for those special assignments. Think about the leaders you know in business, the military, your community. Do they fit the description of activationist or would you say they are passivationists? Ten times out of ten they’re activationists, people who do things. The fellow who stands on the sidelines, who holds off, who is passive, does not lead. But the doer, the fellow who thinks action, finds others want to follow him. People place confidence in the fellow who acts. They naturally assume he knows what he is doing. I’ve never heard anyone complimented and praised because “he doesn’t disturb anyone,” “he doesn’t take action,” or “he waits until he’s told what to do.”

Tom’s goal does not pilot him in vague generalities. It gives him specific directions in all his activities. When Tom buys a suit, the goal speaks and shows Tom the wise choice. The goal helps to show Tom what steps to take to move up to the next job, what to say in the business conference, what to do when conflict develops, what to read, what stand to take. Should Tom drift a little off course, his automatic instrumentation, housed securely in his subconscious mind, alerts him and tells him what to do to get back on course. Tom’s goal has made him supersensitive to all the many forces at work that affect him. Jack, on the other hand, lacking a goal, also lacks the automatic instrumentation to guide him. He is easily confused. His actions reflect no personal policy. Jack wavers, shifts, guesses at what to do. Lacking consistency of purpose, Jack flounders on the rutty road to mediocrity. May I suggest you reread the above section, right now. Let this concept soak in. Then look around you. Study the very top echelon of successful persons. Note how they, without exception, are totally devoted to their objective. Observe how the life of a highly successful person is integrated around a purpose. Surrender to that goal. Really surrender. Let it obsess you and give you the automatic instrumentation you need to reach that goal.

Here are two ways to use the be-human approach to make you a better leader. First, each time you face a difficult matter, involving people, ask yourself, “What is the human way to handle this?” Ponder over this question when there is a disagreement among your subordinates or when an employee creates a problem. Remember Bob W.’s formula for helping others correct their mistakes. Avoid sarcasm. Avoid being cynical. Avoid taking people down a peg or two. Avoid putting others in their place. Ask, “What is the human way to deal with people?” It always pays—sometimes sooner, sometimes later, but it always pays. A second way to profit from the be-human rule is to let your action show you put people first. Show interest in your subordinates’ off-the-job accomplishments. Treat everyone with dignity. Remind yourself that the primary purpose in life is to enjoy it. As a general rule, the more interest you show in a person, the more he will produce for you. And his production is what carries you forward to greater and greater success.

In my experience, bringing anything into the world requires at least a small helping of obsession. Obsession is the gravity of making. It moves things, it binds them together, and gives them structure. Passion (the good side of obsession) can create great things (like ideas), but if it becomes too singular a fixation (the bad side of obsession), it can be a destructive force. As a maker, which result you experience depends largely on how you discover, engage with, and manage the sources of your obsessions.

I am a serially curious person. Countless things have captured my attention over the years: history, science fiction, film, the architecture of public spaces, mechanical computers, glue, LEGOs, curse words, magic, storytelling, Star Wars, physics, philosophy, armor and weaponry, magic and monsters, new tools, tiny cars, space suits and spaceflight, animal consciousness, eggs. I’ve not found an end to the list of things that have sent me deep down various rabbit holes for exploration.

What I was doing that day on Treasure Island, in a sense, was giving myself my own green light to follow the obsessions that had defined my youth—to follow the secret thrills they produced all the way to their ends, regardless of what I found there, because sometimes what you find there are the best ideas you’ll ever have. I am a maker by trade and a storyteller by temperament, but first I see myself as a “permission machine.” In the beginning of his incredible essay “Self-Reliance,” Ralph Waldo Emerson says: “To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men—that is genius.” The essay and in particular that phrase hit me hard in the solar plexus when I first heard it at eighteen years old, and it continues to today. The deepest truths about your experience are universal truths that connect each of us to each other, and to the world around us. I have found this truth to be the key that unlocks those shackles of shame and self-doubt. It gives you the elbow room to fly your freak flag, the mental space to pay attention to the things that you’re interested in. For the creator within all of us, this is the pathway to ideas and creation.

Here’s the thing about stuffed animal talismans that became obvious once I finally had kids of my own: they are objects that are separate from you, but they also are you. They are both sponge and mirror. They are a projection. The adventures you take them on narratively are your adventures. Onto them you project all the things you want for yourself, that you like about yourself, and what you don’t like about yourself. They are your world.

How I have come up with my stories, how I get ideas for what to make, often comes from my love of movies. But your ideas can come from anywhere. They are out there, floating everywhere. It will be your interest and obsession that create the gravity that draws them to you and then makes them yours. If you can feel that draw, that attraction, and then something catches your interest as a result, PAY ATTENTION TO IT. Being attuned to those pings of interest is the duty of a creator, whether you’re a scientist coming up with a hypothesis, or an artist with a blank canvas in front of you, or a troubadour with a quiet guitar in your hands. We all have brains, and the ability to do remarkable things with them, but what we do with them is up to each of us. Beyond that, there is no magic formula for getting started, I promise. It merely requires that you participate in your world, that you pay attention to what interests you, that you follow the thrills they produce, and that you never be afraid to go deep on them, to obsess over them, to dig through the bottom of the rabbit hole, if necessary, to find that great idea that has been waiting there for you all along.

Use this old but ever-accurate quatrain as a guide: What kind of world would this world be, If everyone in it were just like me? To add meaning to this self-imposed test, substitute the word company for world so it reads: What kind of company would this company be, If everyone in it were just like me? In similar fashion, ask yourself what kind of club, community, school, church would it be if everyone in it acted like you. Think, talk, act, live the way you want your subordinates to think, talk, act, live—and they will. Over a period of time, subordinates tend to become carbon copies of their chief. The simplest way to get high-level performance is to be sure the master copy is worth duplicating.

When this person is forced by circumstances to be physically alone, he finds ways to keep from being mentally alone. At times like these he resorts to television, newspapers, radio, telephone, anything that will take over his thinking process for him. In effect he says, “Here, Mr. TV, Mr. Newspaper, occupy my mind for me. I’m afraid to occupy it with my own thoughts.” Mr. I-can’t-stand-to-be-alone shuns independent thought. He keeps his own mind blacked out. He is, psychologically, scared of his own thoughts. As time goes by, Mr. I-can’t-stand-to-be-alone grows increasingly shallow. He makes many ill-considered moves. He fails to develop firmness of purpose, personal stability. He is, unfortunately, ignorant of the superpower lying unused just behind his forehead. Don’t be a Mr. I-can’t-stand-to-be-alone. Successful leaders tap their superpower through being alone. You can, too. Let’s see how.

A. When Little People Try to Drive You Down, Think Big To be sure, there are some people who want you to lose, to experience misfortune, to be reprimanded. But these people can’t hurt you if you’ll remember three things: 1. You win when you refuse to fight petty people. Fighting little people reduces you to their size. Stay big. 2. Expect to be sniped at. It’s proof you’re growing. 3. Remind yourself that snipers are psychologically sick. Be Big. Feel sorry for them. 4. Think Big Enough to be immune to the attacks of petty people. B. When That “I-Haven’t-Got-What-It-Takes” Feeling Creeps Up On You, Think Big Remember: if you think you are weak, you are. If you think you’re inadequate, you are. If you think you’re second-class, you are. Whip that natural tendency to sell yourself short with these tools: 1. Look important. It helps you think important. How you look on the outside has a lot to do with how you feel on the inside. 2. Concentrate on your assets. Build a sell-yourself-to-yourself commercial and use it. Learn to supercharge yourself. Know your positive self. 3. Put other people in proper perspective. The other person is just another human being, so why be afraid of him? 4. Think Big Enough to see how good you really are! C. When an Argument or Quarrel Seems Inevitable, Think Big Successfully resist the temptation to argue and quarrel by: 1. Asking yourself, “Honestly now, is this thing really important enough to argue about?” 2. Reminding yourself, you never gain anything from an argument but you always lose something. 3. Think Big Enough to see that quarrels, arguments, feuds, and fusses will never help you get where you want to go. D. When You Feel Defeated, Think Big It is not possible to achieve large success without hardships and setbacks. But it is possible to live the rest of your life without defeat. Big thinkers react to setbacks this way: Regard the setback as a lesson. Learn from it. Research it. Use it to propel you forward. Salvage something from every setback. Blend persistence with experimentation. Back off and start afresh with a new approach. Think Big Enough to see that defeat is a state of mind, nothing more. E. When Romance Starts to Slip, Think Big Negative, petty, “She’s-(He’s)-unfair-to-me-so-I’ll-get-even” type of thinking slaughters romance, destroys the affection that can be yours. Do this when things aren’t going right in the love department: 1. Concentrate on the biggest qualities in the person you want to love you. Put little things where they belong—in second place. 2. Do something special for your mate—and do it often. 3. Think Big Enough to find the secret to marital joys. F. When You Feel Your Progress On the Job Is Slowing Down, Think Big No matter what you do and regardless of your occupation, higher status, higher pay come from one thing: increasing the quality and quantity of your output. Do this: Think, “I can do better.” The best is not unattainable. There is room for doing everything better. Nothing in this world is being done as well as it could be. And when you think, “I can do better,” ways to do better will appear. Thinking “I can do better” switches on your creative power. Think Big Enough to see that if you put service first, money takes care of itself. In the words of Publilius Syrus: A wise man will be master of his mind, A fool will be its slave.

In Paris, Satie visited friends or arranged to meet them in cafés. He would also work on his compositions in cafés, but never in restaurants—Satie was a gourmet, and he eagerly looked forward to the evening meal. (Although he appreciated fine food and was meticulous in his tastes, Satie could also apparently eat in tremendous quantities; he once consumed a thirty-egg omelet in a single sitting.) When he could, Satie earned some money in the evening playing piano for cabaret singers. Otherwise, he would make another round of the cafés, drinking a good deal. The last train back to Arcueil left at 1:00 A.M., but Satie frequently missed it. Then he would walk the several miles home, sometimes not arriving until the sun was about to rise. Nevertheless, as soon as they next morning dawned, he would set off to Paris once more.

“One can be very fertile without having to work too much,” Sartre once said. “Three hours in the morning, three hours in the evening. This is my only rule.” If that makes the French philosopher’s life sound relaxed, however, it’s misleading. Sartre lived in a creative frenzy for most of his life, alternating between his daily six hours of work and an intense social life filled with rich meals, heavy drinking, drugs, and tobacco. On a typical day, Sartre worked in his Paris apartment until noon, then went out for an hour of appointments scheduled by his secretary. At 1:30, he joined his companion, Simone de Beauvoir (see this page), and their friends for lunch—a two-hour affair, washed down with a quart of red wine. At 3:30 on the dot he pushed away from the table and rushed back to his apartment for his second period of work, this time joined by Beauvoir. At night he slept badly, knocking himself out for a few hours with barbiturates.

I think a lot of creative people look at planning tools like list making that way at some point in their lives. Planning is for parents. Lists are for accountants and teachers and bureaucrats and all the other agents of creative repression! But here’s the thing: lists aren’t external to the creative process, they are intrinsic to it. They are a natural part of any project of scale, whether we like it or not.

Completism can certainly tip toward perfectionism and into a negative feedback loop, but there is also great utility in it—a positive feedback loop—when it comes to list making as a planning tool. It ensures that you capture the totality of your project: the materials you will need; the quantities required; the collaborators you might need to coordinate with; the steps it will take to put those materials together. It’s all there in front of you on the page, in one place. Far from inhibiting creativity or obstructing the making process, lists like these actually unlock your creative potential because they free up all that brainpower you would have otherwise been using to remember all this information.

I spread all the lists out in front of me on the living room floor and meticulously copied their contents onto a single page in the tiniest writing I could manage, so that I could “see” all the work we had to do, all at once. This was an important moment. The moment at which our first show took real shape in my head. This wasn’t the original goal of transcribing my lists, mind you. There was no conscious intent on my part to make a master list on a single page in order to tame this beast. And yet, with the entirety of the show’s elements in front of me, that’s exactly what happened. Once I could see the whole thing, the show became a singular, manageable project in my head instead of an endless series of separate, overwhelming tasks. This, I quickly understood, is the abiding power of a well-made list. When your project feels like a lion that needs to be tamed, a comprehensive checklist can be both the whip and the chair.

The value of a list is that it frees you up to think more creatively, by defining a project’s scope and scale for you on the page, so your brain doesn’t have to hold on to so much information. The beauty of the checkbox is that it does the same thing with regard to progress, allowing you to monitor the status of your project, without having to mentally keep track of everything. You can see everything about your project in a list with checkboxes. I incorporated the checkbox into my process immediately and it changed my work practice at ILM overnight. Every day from that day forward, I would make a new daily list of goals complete with checkboxes, while at the same time keeping an eye on how that day’s goals fit into the bigger picture. I’d make that day’s list of goals by looking at yesterday’s list, and transferring only the unstarted or partially completed items to today’s list. It was a great way for me to wrap my head around the day, the week, the month, and my job in general. I became known for being so meticulous about tracking my progress through my lists, in fact, that it opened me up to the occasional prank from my coworkers. I’d come into the shop in the morning, ready to set myself to the task of creating that day’s to-do list, only to find “uncompleted” items added to the previous day’s list: “Buy Mike Lynch lunch”; “Give Brian G $10.” Har har. The power and importance of the checkbox for me simply cannot be overstated. On the one hand, it speaks, as I’ve said, to the completist in me. The best part of making a list is, you guessed it, crossing things off. But when you physically cross them out, like with a pen, you can make them harder to read, which destroys their informational value beyond that single project and, to me at least, makes the whole thing feel incomplete. The checkbox allowed me to cross something off my list, to see clearly that I’d crossed it off, and at the same time retain all its information while not also adding to the cognitive load of interpreting the list.

In my mind, a list is how I describe and understand the mass of a project, its overall size and the weight that it displaces in the world, but the checkbox can also describe the project’s momentum. And momentum is key to finishing anything. Momentum isn’t just physical, though. It’s mental, and for me it’s also emotional. I gain so much energy from staring at a bunch of colored-in checkboxes on the left side of a list, that I’ve been known to add things I’ve already done to a list, just to have more checkboxes that are dark than are empty. That sense of forward progress keeps me enthusiastically plugging away at rudimentary, monotonous tasks as well as huge projects that seem like they might never end—and

To be fair to myself, impatience does have its upsides. Deadlines and goals are very useful tools. They refine decision trees, and provide momentum when things get boring. Whenever I’m doing something tedious, I’ll admit to myself that it can be crushingly boring to do the same thing time after time for hours, and then I will use that bit of my own psychology in a constructive way and set arbitrary goals for myself.

There’s one group of makers who understands intuitively, perhaps more than anyone else, the multifaceted value proposition that knolling represents: chefs. They call it mise en place. Coined in the late nineteenth century by famed French chef Auguste Escoffier, mise en place translates roughly to “everything in its place.” The principle behind it, cribbed from Escoffier’s military service during the Franco-Prussian War, is really about order and discipline. James Beard Award–winning chef of San Francisco’s Jardinière (and my son’s boss), Traci Des Jardins, describes mise en place more plainly: “It’s so inherent to what we do, it’s just what we call having your shit together.”

In retrospect, the most obvious mistake I made was thinking I could build the whole set by myself. At the time, this mistake did not seem so self-evident. I was always pretty clever at figuring stuff out on my own. Whether it was circus arts or solving Rubik’s Cubes or putting things together, I’d become obsessed with a skill, then study and learn and practice it until I was better than most people. But “better than most” at casual stuff does not translate to “good enough” when you’re being paid to bring someone’s vision to life. You need all hands on deck when you’re hired to make something for somebody else, and at nineteen or twenty years old, mine were the only two hands whose use I knew how to recruit.

In this sense, help is more than just an extra pair of hands or an extra set of eyes. Help is expertise. It’s wisdom. It’s learning enough to understand and admit to what you don’t know.

The clarifying power of a deadline is something that every maker should embrace in their own work. We should be asking ourselves repeatedly, “What is the essence of this project?” as we move down the path toward completion. And as the delivery deadline nears, we should ask that question more frequently, because it helps us remember why we’re there, and what the point of the whole project is. This is especially true if you’re working on something for yourself, because then it can become anything. And if it can become anything, then what is it really? A deadline shouldn’t feel like a vise slowly crushing your head, it should feel like a sieve through which only the essential elements get pushed by the pressure of time, leaving the unnecessary bits behind.

In my experience, it won’t matter, because what your friend eventually produces will look so radically different than the image you tried to describe you will wonder if they were listening at all. The differences will shock you. You will wonder if you were speaking a foreign language.

Despite the fact that I haven’t, until quite recently, felt particularly skilled at it, I’ve been drawing most all my life. I draw every single day, for a multitude of reasons. I use drawing to flesh out and perfect my ideas. I use it to communicate with other builders and colleagues. I use it to create momentum. I use it to capture knowledge developed over the course of a project. And, of course, I use it for ideation.

Making things, just like physics (of our universe at least), is all about momentum. When you’re in the flow, the momentum of a project is hearty and good. When you hit a roadblock—writer’s block, builder’s block, designer’s block—there is no movement and the pathway forward is not at all clear, which often kills momentum and can stall a project. Here’s something true: there will be times in every single build when a pathway isn’t clear. These roadblocks, or momentum killers as I’ve come to refer to them, aren’t outliers. In fact, they are abundant and nobody is immune to them. Financial problems, procrastination, fatigue, family obligations, mistakes, accidents, lack of interest, lack of time, poor feedback—any one of these things can bring your project to a screeching halt and destroy all the creative momentum you’ve gathered. I frequently use drawing as a tool or a technique to break through that dam. Drawing always gives me a new vantage point on the project and allows me to see the thing I’m building with enough distance to identify the next step more clearly. In that regard it’s almost immaterial what I draw. I might draw some reference pictures for a collaborator to understand what I need from their contribution, or to see where their contribution fits in the wider picture. I might draw some mechanical subassemblies that are kicking my ass. I might re-draw the item I’m making for fun, just to stay inside the construction in my head. I might draw a case for the object, or a case I’d like to build for it when it’s done. Sometimes the exercise of thinking about what might contain the thing I’m working on can help me define better what it is I’m actually building and help illuminate what has me stuck. It’s all information. A conversation between my brain and my hands.

Momentum is, of course, all about movement. Experience has taught me that forward movement, however small, is the only way through a blockage like this. It’s important to understand, however, that this movement will never be a straight, linear, unbroken path. It’s more like an oscillation, a beat, a rhythm even. When I can’t make, I draw to find that rhythm again, to create that little bit of forward movement that is the only thing that can slay the dragon of inertia.

There’s an online forum I frequent, for example, called Replica Prop Forum, where fellow prop collectors, builders, traders, and makers dissect their favorite movie props and artifacts. Some members use the site to chronicle their builds, others use it as a marketplace to buy and sell replicas they’ve either made or collected.

Every maker needs to give themselves the space to screw up in the pursuit of perfecting a new skill or in learning something they’ve never tried before. Screwing up IS learning. One of the best ways to do that is by giving yourself a cushion with materials. If you’re an aspiring fashion designer, for example, and you have a new dress idea that calls for four yards of fabric and some unique construction methods, when you go down to the fabric store don’t buy four yards of fabric. Buy eight. Buy TWELVE. If cost is an issue, buy half of it in the cheapest fabric you can find and half in the expensive stuff you actually want.

Kurt Vonnegut was fond of saying, “Travel plans gone astray are dancing lessons from God.” I think that’s the actual mystery solved of the creative process. That’s what keeps us coming back for more after every bonehead error, every wrong turn, every misfire, every disproven assumption, and, ultimately, every finished project. We just have to loosen our tolerance with ourselves and give ourselves the space to make all those mistakes. It’s the only way we’ll learn, the only way we’ll grow, the only way we’ll make anything truly great.

Nuts, bolts, threaded inserts, thread repair coils, cotter pins, keyways, dovetails, rivets, even hook and loop. Welded studs, leather rivets, grommets, lacing eyelets, 80/20 extruded bar. Mechanical fasteners make everything about an initial build take longer, and they require planning and foresight to make sure whichever fasteners you choose register to each other, and to the parts you’re working with. But after they’ve been built in, mechanical fasteners make everything after that easier. They allow for disassembly, reconfiguration, as well as replacement. That trade-off, of spending time up front to save it on the back end, is one of those choices that becomes clearer with the more experience you get.

And keeping my options open is one of the reasons that during high-traffic times I like to avoid the freeways. Freeways limit options. City streets, while often taking longer to drive through, leave options open at every juncture. Glue does not come with options. Glue something and when it’s set, pulling it cleanly apart again does not work. And trying to make it an option is often catastrophic. That’s the reason I prefer mechanical solutions. They can be undone. Whatever I’m putting together can be pulled apart again without damaging the construction. Like navigating the hilly labyrinthine streets of San Francisco, it takes more engineering, more fiddling, and definitely more time. But the trade-off is more options. And I want options. That’s the space I like to exist in as a maker.

Sharing what I know is a personal mission. It’s a key part of how I balance the scales for the incredible gifts I’ve been given. Whatever success I’ve enjoyed in my life has always been directly related to those who’ve supported me, and to all of the amazing people I’ve been lucky enough to meet, know, collaborate with, and learn from. As a maker and storyteller, I see myself as part of a continuum, going back to the beginning of humans using tools and telling stories, and continuing forward into infinite possible futures. Sharing information is the fuel for the engine of progress. However, I’ve run into many people who don’t believe in sharing their work, or more specifically, that sharing their work, their methodologies, their custom processes, even their enthusiasm, incurs a direct cost to them. I have been tangling with this kind of cynicism and parochial, scarcity mind-set for most of my career. I understand it intellectually, but emotionally I will never understand it. Why would you not want to share the things you love? Why would you not want to share the cool things you’ve made? Or the triumph of a challenging project that you’ve overcome with your friends? Why would you hide the knowledge you’ve acquired over the years or pretend that your hopes and dreams aren’t worth shouting from the rooftops? In my experience, the more you give away, the richer you will be (to paraphrase Paul McCartney). I’ve felt this way as long as I can remember.

“You will eventually use everything you’ve ever learned,” someone once told Steve Martin about his budding comedy career.I Indeed, every job I’ve ever had, from unpaid programmer for public access cable television, to library page, to busboy, to graphic designer, to actor, to scenic painter, to toy designer, has come into play in what I do professionally. Of course, this instinct to share what you’ve done extends beyond finding a job. It applies equally to starting your own business, finding collaborators, or just planting your flag in the ground as a maker. Sharing your work announces your presence. Being vocal about your achievements is an investment in yourself. It doesn’t have to be big and showy. Don’t be a blowhard (I say this for my own benefit as well). You don’t need to be perfectly polished. Start a blog or an Instagram account. Go to ’cons and meetups and exhibitions. Give yourself a name. Embrace the noun (Maker, Painter, Writer, Designer) by sharing with the world evidence that you’ve been living the verb (making, painting, writing, designing).

I visited Guillermo del Toro on the set of Pacific Rim. I was gobsmacked by the sheer scale of the endeavor he’d undertaken. He was in charge of hundreds of people who were all charged with working together toward a gigantic shared vision of huge robots fighting massive monsters—world building on a nearly inconceivable scale. How does one even begin to captain such a gigantic ship? How is it possible to manage a group of dozens of artists to keep to a cohesive vision? At dinner that night I asked Guillermo how he did it. “You have to give everyone complete autonomy within a narrow bandwidth,” he replied. What he meant was that after you get their buy-in on the larger vision, you need to strictly define their roles in the fulfillment of that vision, and then you need to set them free to do their thing. You want the people helping you to be energized and involved; you want them contributing their creativity, not just following your orders. Giving them creative autonomy rewards their individual genius while keeping them oriented to the North Star of your larger shared vision. Whether you are the captain of your creative ship or the lowest swabbie relegated to the poop deck of the project, the fact remains that none of us is an island. We are each of us part of a community, never more so than when we are makers, creating new worlds out of our imaginations. It’s nice to think we can do it alone. It pushes all our ego buttons to consider ourselves the singular genius. But experience shows all makers that every success is a shared success, and every shared success is an investment into the culture that produced the success in the first place. I believe the world is a better place when we’re all pulling on the same rope.

Woody Allen (b. 1935) When he’s not shooting a film, most of Allen’s creative energy goes toward mentally working out the problems of a new story. This is the hard part; once he’s satisfied with the story elements, the writing itself comes easy (and the filmmaking is mostly a chore). But to get the story right requires “obsessive thinking,” Allen has said. To keep from getting stuck in a rut, he’s developed a few reliable tricks. I’ve found over the years that any momentary change stimulates a fresh burst of mental energy. So if I’m in this room and then I go into the other room, it helps me. If I go outside to the street, it’s a huge help. If I go up and take a shower it’s a big help. So I sometimes take extra showers. I’ll be down here [in the living room] and at an impasse and what will help me is to go upstairs and take a shower. It breaks up everything and relaxes me.

David Lynch (b. 1946) “I like things to be orderly,” Lynch told a reporter in 1990. For seven years I ate at Bob’s Big Boy. I would go at 2:30, after the lunch rush. I ate a chocolate shake and four, five, six, seven cups of coffee—with lots of sugar. And there’s lots of sugar in that chocolate shake. It’s a thick shake. In a silver goblet. I would get a rush from all this sugar, and I would get so many ideas! I would write them on these napkins. It was like I had a desk with paper. All I had to do was remember to bring my pen, but a waitress would give me one if I remembered to return it at the end of my stay. I got a lot of ideas at Bob’s. Lynch’s other means of getting ideas is Transcendental Meditation, which he has practiced daily since 1973. “I have never missed a meditation in thirty-three years,” he wrote in his 2006 book, Catching the Big Fish. “I meditate once in the morning and again in the afternoon, for about twenty minutes each time. Then I go about the business of my day.” If he’s shooting a film, he will sometimes sneak in a third session at the end of the day. “We waste so much time on other things, anyway,” he writes. “Once you add this and have a routine, it fits in very naturally.”

Mencken typically divided his working day as follows: reading manuscripts and answering mail in the morning (he replied to every letter he received on the same day, firing off at least one hundred thousand missives in his life), editorial chores in the afternoon, and concentrated writing in the evening. Unbelievably, he claimed to have a lazy temperament. “Like most men, I am lazy by nature and seize every opportunity to loaf,” he wrote in a 1932 letter. But this only made him work harder; believing that he was inclined to indolence, Mencken didn’t allow himself the luxury of free time. His compulsiveness meant that he was astonishingly productive throughout his life—and yet, at age sixty-four, he could nevertheless write, “Looking back over a life of hard work … my only regret is that I didn’t work even harder.”

At 11:00 P.M. Gould began another, longer round of telephone calls, often lasting until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. Many of his friends have described the experience of receiving a Gould call: without bothering to ask if it was a good time or making any attempt at preliminary small talk, Gould would launch into whatever was on his mind, chatting away happily for as long as he pleased—sometimes hours—while the receiving party had no choice but to submit to his cheerful, rambling soliloquy. “He was known to read whole essays and books, to sing whole pieces of music over the phone, and several of his musical collaborators have recalled that he even liked to rehearse over the phone, singing through his piano part,” Kevin Bazzana writes in Wondrous Strange: The Life and Art of Glenn Gould. (Gould’s phone bill, Bazzana adds, “routinely ran to four figures.”) It was almost impossible to get off the phone with him, although if you fell asleep during the call he probably wouldn’t notice. His phone calls over, Gould would visit a local all-night diner for his sole meal of the day: scrambled eggs, salad, toast, juice, sherbet, and decaf coffee. Eating more frequently made him feel guilty, he said, although he snacked on arrowroot biscuits, Ritz crackers, tea, water, orange juice, and coffee throughout his waking hours. (On recording days he didn’t eat at all; fasting, he said, makes the mind sharper.) Finally, at 5:00 or 6:00 A.M., just as the sun was starting to rise, Gould would take a sedative and go to bed.

As a maker, I took that leap once I stepped back from my aluminum doctor’s bags and my deconstructed Kennedy stacks on rolling ladder racks and I realized that everything I was looking at in my shop was a reflection of my philosophy on making. Everything I used the most, everything I loved the most, was laid out in a way that increased its visibility or its accessibility, and was stored on something I either bought or built with an eye toward speed and agility. Everything I used least, everything that made me nuts, was always something that slowed me down. That understanding produced a leap in my creative consciousness that got me started trying to turn as much of what drove me batty into something that drove me wild.

TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR INNER VOICE Do you have a little voice that talks to you in your head? If you are not sure, you are probably asking yourself, "Do I have a little voice or don't I?" We all have a little voice, and it has a huge influence on our concentration and our lives. You are constantly talking to yourself but the only problem is that you catch yourself doing things wrong. Start to catch yourself doing more things right. How or where did you concentrate well today? In what area of your life do you need to stop ‘beating’ yourself up? Your inner voice has the ability to offer instructions so instruct yourself well. It is the center of your focus of control that helps you explain and make sense of your world. Don’t agree with the wrong voices; all self-hatred and conflict is just a thought or a little voice… so change the thought. It is not set in stone. Remember: if you give yourself bad commands, then bad things will happen.

You don’t worry because you care; you worry because that is what you have learned to do. Worry is a very creative mental process. The questions you ask in your mind create your worries. If you ask 'what if' questions, you set your mind up to worry. If you consistently ask, “What if I lose my job? What if I crash my car? What if criminals attack me?” All these ‘what if’ phrases create ‘movies’ in your mind that constantly loop different scenarios, which creates a state of worry. Rather, say to yourself, “What would I do if I lost my job? What would I do if I crashed my car?” These movies that are created by these questions don't loop you into worry. They give you action steps that direct your mind. Create a procedure for different scenarios and make peace with your thinking.

Two years later, it was in making with cardboard once again that I first encountered this sense of deep serenity. At the time I couldn’t explain the sensation—I could only follow it—but years Iater I would come to learn that psychologists often refer to it as the “Oceanic Feeling,” a oneness with the universe. I was about fourteen years old, and I had decided, after a bunch of paper modeling, to go big and make myself a cardboard man out of another refrigerator box I’d dragged home through the neighborhood. I cannot explain why I made what I did, but I knew instantly that in its construction I had encountered something truly special. It felt like I’d scratched the surface of something important. I was, in one moment, completely overcome with this very fascinating feeling. It was neither ecstatic nor frightening. The best way I can describe it is of feeling both infinitesimal and universal at the same time. As if I were both the smallest thing in a room at the same time as being the room itself. (I promise, I wasn’t high.) The tension of those two competing, yet covalent states, was invigorating. When I was done with my cardboard man, I remember distinctly going into the kitchen and telling my mom: “Mom, I wanted to let you know that on this day, in September 1981, I am truly happy.”

When my wife and I bought our first house together, one of the very first things I did was to measure every single room and build a 1/24th cardboard scale model of the house and the lot it sat on, including our backyard. The primary reason I did it was to get to know the house. By building my house in scale, and giving myself a bird’s-eye view of my shelter, I was putting the totality of it into my head, and into my body. It taught me things about it I might not have learned otherwise. For instance, I figured out how to move the HVAC system into a better spot on the second floor by finding a blank spot behind a closet. It also became an invaluable way to talk to our landscapers about where to plant trees, our architect about building a deck out behind the house, and each other about where to put various pieces of furniture. (It helped that I built scale models of most of the furniture in the house out of cardboard, as well.) When we moved on up and bought our second house several years later, again the first thing I did was to build an architectural model of it. The architect we hired to renovate the ground floor was both humored and impressed by it and it became an indispensable tool for discussing options.

I learned this lesson about tool choice and usage from my friend Mark Buck, whom I worked with at ILM. Mark had a round, kind face and an awesome goatee that belied a fine mind, a biting wit, and amazing building skills. He was a man with an aversion to fools and a love for tools. If he walked by your workbench and he saw you looking too long for something in your toolbox, he’d instruct you in an almost solemn tone, like a sifu, “Remember, in every tool, there is a hammer.”I What he meant was that every tool can be used for a purpose for which it wasn’t intended, including the most basic of operations, like hammering. He also meant that until you learn to see what tools can do beyond their stated purpose, you can’t quite be a maker. Truer words have rarely been spoken.

Do we really need all these different saw blades? Can’t we get away with maybe fewer than twenty-three different types of hammers? The answer, of course, is yes, but it wasn’t until I talked to Kevin Kelly, the legendary founding editor of Wired magazine and a tool enthusiast, that I truly understood why, as makers, we should embrace the diversity, and why I, personally, have so many tools.

“Freeman Dyson, a famous physicist, suggested that science moves forward by inventing new tools,” Kevin began as we talked on the phone one morning all about tools. “When we invented the telescope, suddenly we had astrophysicists, and astronomy, and we moved forward. The invention of the microscope opened up the small world of biology to us. In a broad sense, science moves forward by inventing tools, because when you have those tools they give you a new way of thinking.”

My entire organizational strategy, every second of sweeping and straightening I do at the end of each day, is about keeping up the momentum of my making. When I step into the shop each morning, the state of the shop will influence what happens in there. If the shop is messy, and I have to start the day just putting everything away, that has a small but appreciable effect upon my momentum. It starts me off the blocks with shoes made of lead. For someone who likes to work fast and use the momentum of iteration to bring out the best solutions in each of my complex builds, starting the day with cleaning is like starting off the Christmas tree decorating with a Gordian knot of lights. It’s death. But when the shop is clean, and I come in to an empty bench and racks full of tools where they should be, and I plop that day’s project down and regard how to begin for the day, it feels like the air is electric with possibility. Grabbing that first tool feels so good, so right. Why would I not start every day that way if I could? It’s fifteen or twenty minutes at the end of one day, in exchange for a fully productive six or eight or ten hours the following day.

I want you to imagine that you are washing a tin; really see it in your mind. As you wash the tin, it suddenly begins developing a huge Adams apple. A chef and her son grab the Adams apple and rip it out. The Chef and her son then decide to make some medicine, which they give to Marilyn Monroe and she starts to develop a massive Adams apple too. Michael Jackson sees her Adams apple throbbing and runs away screaming and jumps into a van with beer in it. The van is being driven by a big yellow hairy sun – really see it, make it silly, hairy, and let it stick. The hairy sun doesn’t drive very well and crashes into a tiler tilling his wall. The tiler’s tiles are polka dot tiles. A tailor takes the polka dots off and starts tailoring you a polka-dotted suite. Now recall the story and all the key words. If you didn’t get it all, read it again and make the links stronger. See if you can do it backwards too. What you have just learned are the first twelve presidents of the USA. You can continue remembering all forty-four Presidents just by linking one thought to the next. If you have any problems recalling the list just make it more outstanding and make the links clearer. Here is the list of the first twelve Presidents: 1. Washing a tin - Washington 2. Adams apple - Adams 3. A chef and her son - sounds like Jefferson 4. Medicine - sounds like Madison 5.

COMPARISON CONNECTION With this method you connect the person to a name that you already know. Let’s say we meet a person by the name of George. To make the name stick, we think of someone that we already know with the same name. Do you know another George? You may even think of someone famous with the same name, like George Clooney.

FACE CONNECTION With this method you make a link between the name and an outstanding feature on the person’s face. Every person’s face is unique and every face has an outstanding feature. Let me give you an example, imagine you are introduced to a woman and the first thing you notice about her face is that she has striking blue eyes. That will then be her outstanding feature. When she gives you her name you will then have a place to put the name. Imagine she says her name is Janice. You then make an image of the name: Janice sounds like chain ice. You then make the connection and think of a chain of ice flying out of her blue eyes.

0 is the S, Z or C sound: S sounds like the hissing of a wheel (which looks like 0): 1 represents the T or D sound: 2 is the N sound: 3 is the M sound: If I make the word TOMATOES, what will the number be? T: 1, O: no value, M: 3, A: no value, T: 1, O: no value, E: no value and S: 0. The number would be 1310. What word could you make for 321? 3: M, 2: N and 1: D or T. We have the letters MNT or MND. If we add the vowel ‘i’ we have the word Mint, or if we add a ‘d’ at the end and the vowel ‘e’ we have Mend. Or, try the vowel ‘a’ and add a ‘y’, then you can make the name Mandy. It is like learning a new number language. 4 is the R sound: 5 is the L sound: 6 is the J, Sh, soft Ch or soft G sound: What word can you make with 654?

There are many advantages to knowing this method of memory. You can use it to learn 100 bits of information easily and in order. Once you have these values you can remember any numbers and there is no limit. When each number represents an image you can hold the number in your mind and place it on a system to remember as many numbers as you choose. I have also used this method to remember athletic and sports statistics, stock prices, and any key information relating to numbers. This method also works well to remember important dates in history. I enjoy remembering dates because it links historical events to a time line. Once this information is in your memory it is easy to correlate it to other events. With this method, I am able to remember up to 100 dates in five minutes. Plus, this is just another method that allows you to trap your thoughts and make information easier to recall.

All of the systems taught in this book can be enhanced by turning them into a drawing, painting or picture. When you use more of your creativity you will be using more of your memory.

SUCCESS To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded. Once you have found your keywords, the next step is to create images out of them and place it on one of the systems that you have learned in this book. Remember it is like your imagination is the pen and the system is the paper. You can use a journey, your body, a car or anything that is already in your long-term memory. You can even link all the concepts together like you did with the presidents. Let me get you started; let’s use a tree to remember the key concepts. Why a tree? Because it represents growth for me, and it is in your Long-term memory. Imagine the roots laughing and intelligent people (you can imagine Einstein) are sitting at the base of the tree. Imagine children hugging the trunk of the tree (affection of children), and on the branches you can imagine a nest (honest) full of critics. You will notice that we have connected the first few key words to your system, and with a bit of repetition you will have it all in place. If you choose, you can continue to connect the rest of the information to the leaves, thorns, and the fruit or to a park where the tree is planted. Once you have the key concepts then you need to read through the material a few times. The key words will make the text ‘stickier’ and your knowledge of English will help you to remember the syntax. Make the material come to life and you will remember more!

Knowing what you have already learned in this book, you now know that to remember something well you need to bring it to life. So how do you bring cards to life? First, we must create a picture for each card. Each card must have its own identity, so that you can distinguish it from the others and then place it on a long-term place or system. You can associate each card with a person that you know or you can make all the diamond cards celebrities, all the heart cards your family, spade cards people you work with, and the club cards your friends. That would be one way of organizing it. With the system that I use, you will need to know the number code system from Chapter 12. The card system works in the same way as with numbers. Only this time, the first letter of each suite will start the name of each card e.g. the 3 of diamonds will be D for diamonds and 3 = M, add a vowel and you have DaM. All the Diamond cards will start with a D; all the hearts will start with H etc. And then you just add the converted number to the end of the card. Here are all the images for all the suites: Diamonds A – Date (Ace is 1) 2 – Dan 3 – Dam 4 – Door 5 – Deal 6 – Dish 7 – Duck 8 – Dove 9 – Deep 10 – Dice (10 will be zero, s sound) J – Diamond (Jacks will always be the image of the suite) K – Ding (With Kings we use a word with ‘ing’ in it) Q – Dean (With Queens we use a rhyming word) Heart A – Hat 2 – Hen 3 – Ham 4 – Hair 5 – Hail 6 – Hash (hash brown) 7 – Hack 8 – Hoof 9 – Hoop 10 – House J – Heart (Jacks will always be the image of the suite) K – Hinge (With Kings we use a word with ‘ing’ in it) Q – Your queen of hearts (E.g. Princes Diana) Spades A – Sit 2 – Sun 3 – Sam (Uncle Sam) 4 – Sir 5 – Seal 6 – Sash 7 – Sack 8 – Safe 9 – Soap 10 – Seas J – Spade (Jacks will always be the image of the suite) K – Sing (With Kings we use a word with ‘ing’ in it) Q – Steam (With Queens we use a rhyming word) Clubs A – Cat 2 – Can 3 – Camo (camouflage) 4 – Car 5 – Coal 6 – Cash 7 – Cake 8 – Cafe 9 – Cap 10 – Case J – Club (Jacks will always be the image of the suite) K – King (With Kings we use a word with ‘ing’ in it) Q – Cream (With Queens we use a rhyming word) Let’s practice: imagine a King bashing down the Door and entering your House. He finds some Ham and Duck to eat in your fridge. With that silly story you remembered five cards – King of Clubs, 4 of Diamonds, 10 of Hearts, 3 of Hearts and 7 of Diamonds. Easy isn’t it?

Before you study anything make sure you have a strong PIC (Purpose, Interest and Curiosity) in mind. Review Chapter 4 to get more details on the PIC principle. Your vision will determine how much energy you will have for your learning and how hard you will be willing to work. When studying it is also important to take breaks, as our mind can remain focused for only so long before we become unproductive and tense. When you return from a break you will feel refreshed and do more work in less time. Every 35 to 40 minutes take a break, take a walk and get away from whatever you’re working on and give your mind a rest. Get an overview and analyze the material that you have to cover. Mark out all the areas that you need to remember. In any subject the same concepts keep coming up, so make images for these key concepts and create an image ‘vocabulary’. This is so that you don’t have to keep on finding images for information that you have already created. Then create a memory system that will work for each section and store the information. Record your systems and go through them a few times to make sure you have all the content in your head. I have had students that have used one shopping centre to remember their entire syllabus. Using the methods, shared in this book, you will never have the experience of not being able to get information into your head again. No matter what information you need to learn, these methods can be adapted so that you can find a solution and make the information ‘sticky’. I have helped thousands of people to learn all kinds of material for school and university. I have helped medical students, law students, pilots, policeman, nurses, medical reps, miners, ornithologists, marketers and engineers. There isn’t an area of study that won’t benefit from these methods. These methods have no limits; the only limits are the excuses and judgments that you may place on them with your whining mind. Some people say, “I’m not creative and I don’t make pictures”, when I hear people say that to me, all I hear is, “I’m too lazy to put in the effort”. If you choose to believe in limits you will live a limited life.

The image that best defines this for me is the slow motion shot you get as they replay the 100 meters sprint on television. You know the one, it’s where you can see every part of their body moving around in far too much detail. Those runners at the front are usually very relaxed, very composed. Their cheeks wobble up and down and sway from side to side. In that moment they’re the personification of the perfect mental balance between focus and relaxation. But if you look at those doing the chasing, they usually have very tight grimaces as they realize the race is getting away from them. The grimace is a response to that realization, a tightening-up as they apply more effort. This is something to think about when you’re applying mindfulness in everyday life. How much effort are you applying? Not to the 100 meters sprint, but to the simple things, opening and closing doors, wiping down a work surface, holding on to the steering wheel, turning off the tap, brushing your teeth. As you go about your day, start to notice just how much effort you put into these things. One thing is for sure, the level of effort you apply to life will almost certainly be reflected in your meditation.

Because you’re more present and more aware, it’s quite likely that the way you think when you run (your mental habits) will also become more apparent. Do you have a tendency to be hard or kind to yourself when you’re running? Where does the mind instinctively go? Is it inward toward thinking, or outward toward sensations in the body? Is there a strong feeling of confidence, or of self-consciousness? All of these things you can start to notice as you do this exercise. You can also notice when the body begins to respond to the running process, when it releases the endorphins, when you start to feel invincible, as though you could run forever (assuming that happens at some stage on your run). One of the so-called problems of being more aware is that you become aware of not only the pleasant sensations, but also the unpleasant ones. However, used in the right way even the unpleasant sensations can be put to good effect. Rather than try to “get away” from physical discomfort, see what happens when you rest your attention with the feeling. Try doing it as if you and the pain are not really separate, so less of “me and my pain” and more of the simple, direct experience of “pain.” The results might surprise you.

Mao’s strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First, be certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a fight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the Japanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no apparent enemies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even turning a friend into an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in politics. Third, use such enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing it as a struggle of good against evil. Mao actually encouraged China’s disagreements with the Soviet Union and the United States; without clear-cut enemies, he believed, his people would lose any sense of what Chinese Communism meant. A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument for your side than all the words you could possibly put together.

Never let the presence of enemies upset or distress you—you are far better off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your real enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to enhance his reputation as a surefooted fighter who can be relied upon in times of uncertainty.

"Quite true," he said. "Since death comes anyway, what does it matter if it comes early or late? There's so little difference." "Then what on earth made you become a doctor if you feel like that?" I demanded with some indignation. "Oh, my dear fellow - doctoring isn't just a matter of dodging the ultimate end - it's a lot more - it's improving living. If a healthy man dies, it doesn't matter - much. If an imbecile - a cretin - dies, it's a good thing - but if by the discovery of administering the correct gland you turn your cretin into a healthy, normal individual by correcting his thyroid deficiency, that, to my mind, matters a good deal." I looked at him with more interest. I still felt that it would not be Dr. Franklin I should call in if I had the influenza, but I had to pay tribute to a kind of white-hot sincerity and a very real force in the man. I had noticed a change in him since his wife's death. He had displayed few of the conventional signs of mourning. On the contrary he seemed more alive, less absent-minded, and full of a new energy and fire.

The player of the inner game comes to value the art of relaxed concentration above all other skills; he discovers a true basis for self-confidence; and he learns that the secret to winning any game lies in not trying too hard. He aims at the kind of spontaneous performance which occurs only when the mind is calm and seems at one with the body, which finds its own surprising ways to surpass its own limits again and again. Moreover, while overcoming the common hang-ups of competition, the player of the inner game uncovers a will to win which unlocks all his energy and which is never discouraged by losing.

The next time your opponent is having a hot streak, simply ask him as you switch courts, “Say, George, what are you doing so differently that’s making your forehand so good today?” If he takes the bait—and 95 percent will—and begins to think about how he’s swinging, telling you how he’s really meeting the ball out in front, keeping his wrist firm and following through better, his streak invariably will end. He will lose his timing and fluidity as he tries to repeat what he has just told you he was doing so well.

“I,” seems to give instructions; the other, “myself,” seems to perform the action. Then “I” returns with an evaluation of the action. For clarity let’s call the “teller” Self 1 and the “doer” Self 2. Now we are ready for the first major postulate of the Inner Game: within each player the kind of relationship that exists between Self 1 and Self 2 is the prime factor in determining one’s ability to translate his knowledge of technique into effective action. In other words, the key to better tennis—or better anything—lies in improving the relationship between the conscious teller, Self 1, and the natural capabilities of Self 2.

Getting it together mentally in tennis involves the learning of several internal skills: 1) learning how to get the clearest possible picture of your desired outcomes; 2) learning how to trust Self 2 to perform at its best and learn from both successes and failures; and 3) learning to see “nonjudgmentally”—that is, to see what is happening rather than merely noticing how well or how badly it is happening. This overcomes “trying too hard.” All these skills are subsidiary to the master skill, without which nothing of value is ever achieved: the art of relaxed concentration.

In short, “getting it together” requires slowing the mind. Quieting the mind means less thinking, calculating, judging, worrying, fearing, hoping, trying, regretting, controlling, jittering or distracting. The mind is still when it is totally here and now in perfect oneness with the action and the actor. It is the purpose of the Inner Game to increase the frequency and the duration of these moments, quieting the mind by degrees and realizing thereby a continual expansion of our capacity to learn and perform.

What I mean by judgment is the act of assigning a negative or positive value to an event. In effect it is saying that some events within your experience are good and you like them, and other events in your experience are bad and you don’t like them. You don’t like the sight of yourself hitting a ball into the net, but you judge as good the sight of your opponent being aced by your serve. Thus, judgments are our personal, ego reactions to the sights, sounds, feelings and thoughts within our experience.

Be clear about this: letting go of judgments does not mean ignoring errors. It simply means seeing events as they are and not adding anything to them. Nonjudgmental awareness might observe that during a certain match you hit 50 percent of your first serves into the net. It doesn’t ignore the fact. It may accurately describe your serve on that day as erratic and seek to discover the causes. Judgment begins when the serve is labeled “bad” and causes interference with one’s playing when a reaction of anger, frustration or discouragement follows. If the judgment process could be stopped with the naming of the event as bad, and there were no further ego reactions, then the interference would be minimal. But judgmental labels usually lead to emotional reactions and then to tightness, trying too hard, self-condemnation, etc. This process can be slowed by using descriptive but nonjudgmental words to describe the events you see. If a judgmental player comes to me, I will do my best not to believe his tale of a “bad” backhand or of the “bad” player who has it. If he hits the balls out, I will notice they go out, and I may notice the reason why they are going out. But is there a need to judge him or the backhand as sick? If I do, I am likely to get as uptight in the process of correcting him as he is likely to be in correcting himself. Judgment results in tightness, and tightness interferes with the fluidity required for accurate and quick movement. Relaxation produces smooth strokes and results from accepting your strokes as they are, even if erratic.

So instead of stopping the process at the point where the player is judging positively, I again ask him to observe his racket and to tell me exactly where it is at the moment of bounce. As the player finally lets himself observe his racket with detachment and interest, he can feel what it is actually doing and his awareness increases. Then, without any effort to correct, he will discover that his swing has begun to develop a natural rhythm. In fact, he will find the best rhythm for himself, which may be slightly different from what might be dictated by some universal standard called “correct.” Then when he goes out to play, he has no magic phrase that must be repeated, and can focus without thinking.

Through this experience, I began to see how Self 1 operated. Always looking for approval and wanting to avoid disapproval, this subtle ego-mind sees a compliment as a potential criticism. It reasons, “If the pro is pleased with one kind of performance, he will be displeased by the opposite. If he likes me for doing well, he will dislike me for not doing well.” The standard of good and bad had been established, and the inevitable result was divided concentration and ego-interference.

THE FIRST INNER SKILL to be developed in the Inner Game is that of nonjudgmental awareness. When we “unlearn” judgment we discover, usually with some surprise, that we don’t need the motivation of a reformer to change our “bad” habits. We may simply need to be more aware. There is a more natural process of learning and performing waiting to be discovered. It is waiting to show what it can do when allowed to operate without interference from the conscious strivings of the judgmental self. The discovery of and reliance upon this process is the subject of the next chapter. But first, one balancing thought. It is important to remember that not all remarks are judgmental. Acknowledgment of one’s own or another’s strengths, efforts, accomplishments, etc., can facilitate natural learning, whereas judgments interfere. What is the difference? Acknowledgment of and respect for one’s capabilities support trust in Self 2. Self 1’s judgments, on the other hand, attempt to manipulate and undermine that trust.

What does “Trust thyself” mean on the tennis court? It doesn’t mean positive thinking—for example, expecting that you are going to hit an ace on every serve. Trusting your body in tennis means letting your body hit the ball. The key word is let. You trust in the competence of your body and its brain, and you let it swing the racket. Self 1 stays out of it. But though this is very simple, it does not mean that it is easy.

Getting the clearest possible image of your desired outcomes is a most useful method for communicating with Self 2, especially when playing a match. Once you are competing it is too late to work on your strokes, but it is possible to hold in your mind the image of where you want the ball to go and then allow the body to do what is necessary to hit it there. It is essential here to trust Self 2. Self 1 must stay relaxed, refraining from giving “how-to-do-it” instructions and from any effort to control the stroke. As Self 1 learns to let go, a growing confidence in the ability of Self 2 emerges.

“Asking for qualities” describes this other kind of role-playing. When introducing this idea, I usually say something like this: “Imagine that I am the director of a television series. Knowing that you are an actor that plays tennis, I ask if you would like to do a bit part as a top-flight tennis player. I assure you that you needn’t worry about hitting the ball out or into the net because the camera will only be focused on you and will not follow the ball. What I’m mainly interested in is that you adopt professional mannerisms, and that you swing your racket with supreme self-assurance. Above all, your face must express no self-doubt. You should look as if you are hitting every ball exactly where you want to. Really get into the role, hit as hard as you like and ignore where the ball is actually going.” When a player succeeds in forgetting himself and really acts out his assumed role, remarkable changes in his game often take place; if you don’t mind puns, you might even say that the changes are dramatic.

He approaches poker with the same passion and constant inquisitiveness. He loves to follow the up-and-coming players, is hip to the latest apps and programs, never assumes that he’s learned all there is. He refuses to plateau. If I had to assign him a life motto, it would be this: life is too short for complacency. Indeed, when I inevitably ask him the question he gets asked most frequently—what his single piece of advice would be to aspiring poker players—his answer is two words long: pay attention. Two simple words that we simply ignore more often than not. Presence is far more difficult than the path of least resistance.

But life had other ideas. A plan shifted. A framework disappeared and was replaced by something unforeseen. Man plans, God laughs, indeed. Whatever I may think about God, I believe in randomness. In the noise of the universe that chugs along caring nothing about us, our plans, our desires, our motivations, our actions. The noise that will be there regardless of what we choose or don’t choose to do. Variance. Chance. That thing we can’t control no matter how we may try. But can you really blame us for trying?

Until I began this journey, I’d never been a card player. I’d never played poker in my life. I’d never even seen a real game. Poker was a nonentity in my mind. But faced with event after event breaking the wrong way, I did what I always do when I try to understand something. I read. Anything that could help shed light on what was happening, that would allow me to regain some semblance of control. And in my reading frenzy, I came across John von Neumann’s Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. Von Neumann was one of the greatest mathematical and strategic minds of the twentieth century: he invented that little machine we all carry around with us, the computer (back then, it wasn’t so little), crafted the technology behind the hydrogen bomb, and is the father of game theory. Theory of Games is his foundational text, and here’s what I learned within its pages: the entire theory was inspired by a single game—poker. “Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself what is the other man going to think I mean to do,” von Neumann wrote. “And that is what games are about in my theory.” Von Neumann did not care for most card games. They were, he thought, as boring as the people who wasted their lives playing them, trying to coax mastery—impossibly—out of pure chance. Games of pure chance, though, were to his mind not much worse than those at the opposite end: games like chess, where all the information could theoretically be gleaned, where every move could be mathematically accounted for in advance. There was one exception to his distrust of gaming: poker. He loved it. To him, it represented that ineffable balance between skill and chance that governs life—enough skill to make playing worthwhile, enough chance that the challenge was there for the taking. He was a god-awful player by every account, but that never stopped him. Poker was the ultimate puzzle: he wanted to understand it, to unravel it—to, in the end, beat it. If he could figure out how to disentangle the chance from the skill, how to maximize the role of the latter and learn to minimize the malice of the former, he believed he would hold the solution to some of life’s greatest decision challenges.

But I’ve been fluent in French and Spanish in the past, and pretty good in Italian,” I continue. “I used to take Persian, but I’ve really forgotten all of it.” “I think that’s going to be really helpful,” Erik says. “Do you know Phil Ivey?” I nod. He’s one of the only poker names that is on my radar. “There was an argument for him being the best at all of these different poker games at one point,” he explains. I can think of each game like a different language that needs to be mastered. “And what’s extra fascinating about that to me is that his sister is a linguist. And she speaks fifteen languages or something.” I’m impressed. My abilities look meager in comparison. “How many people do you get that have that kind of a brain or interests?” Erik continues. “It seems as if Phil and his sister have a very similar brain that functions in a way that they pick up languages in some incredible way. It’s nice to hear that you do have obviously some abilities to pick up languages quickly or to adapt to different languages, because that’s essentially what the challenge is.”

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO be a year. It became a new life. From novice, I turned champion. From amateur, I went pro. And all along the way, I watched with a mix of wonder and pride as my life changed for the better. This book is the result of that journey. It is not an exhaustive exploration of the game, how to play it, how to win at it, how to excel. It is no guide. That has been covered by experts far greater than I. It is a picking up of von Neumann’s challenge: poker as a lens into the most difficult and important life decisions we have to make, an exploration of chance and skill in life—and an attempt to learn to navigate it and optimize it to the best of our potential. What I will offer throughout is insight into decision making far removed from poker, a translation of what I’m learning in the casino to the decisions I make on a daily basis—and the crucial decisions that I make only rarely, but that carry particular import. From managing emotion, to reading other people, to cutting your losses and maximizing your gains, to psyching yourself up into the best version of yourself so that you can not only catch the bluffs of others but bluff successfully yourself, poker is endlessly applicable and revelatory. The mixture of chance and skill at the table is a mirror to that same mixture in our daily lives—and a way of learning to play within those parameters in superior fashion. Poker teaches you how and when you can take true control—and how you can deal with the elements of pure luck—in a way no other environment I’ve encountered has quite been able to do. What’s more, in an age of omnipresent distraction, poker reminds us just how critical close observation and presence are to achievement and success. How important it is to immerse yourself and to learn new things, truly. As Erik told me that first day, lesson one: pay attention. This book isn’t about how to play poker. It’s about how to play the world.

Indeed, when the economist Ingo Fiedler analyzed hundreds of thousands of hands played on several online poker sites over a six-month period, he found that the actual best hand won, on average, only 12 percent of the time and that less than a third of hands went to showdown (meaning that players were skillful enough to persuade others to let go of their cards prior to the end of the hand). In mid-stakes games, with blinds of 1/2 and 5/10, there were some players who were consistent winners, and as stakes went to nosebleed—50/100 and up—the variability in skill went down significantly. That is, the higher the amount of money for which people played, the greater their actual skill edge. When Chicago economists Steven Levitt and Thomas Miles looked at live play and compared the ROI, or return on investment, for two groups of players at the 2010 WSOP, they found that recreational players lost, on average, over 15 percent of their buy-ins (roughly $400), while professionals won over 30 percent (roughly $1,200). They write, “The observed differences in ROIs are highly statistically significant and far larger in magnitude than those observed in financial markets where fees charged by the money managers viewed as being most talented can run as high as three percent of assets under management and thirty percent of annual returns.” Success in poker, in other words, implies far more skill than success in that far more respectable profession, investing.

Cardano also wrote a description of what many take to be the earliest form of poker, primero. It wasn’t played with a full deck, and the rules of betting were somewhat convoluted, but the essence was similar to the games we have now: some cards private, some in common, and a complex interplay between representing the hand you may or may not have and interpreting the signals of your fellow card players. Primero traveled across Europe, variably termed primiera, la prime, and eventually pochen, a German name derived from the verb “to bluff.” The French took pochen and made it poqué—and soon, the game would morph into a new form. No one knows quite when it made its way across the ocean, but it seems to have taken root, as so many national pastimes, in the muggy heat of a boring summer. It was 1803, and some Frenchmen in Louisiana had grown listless aboard a slow-moving steamship bound for New Orleans. They started up a game of poqué, which would soon spread gradually by steamboat throughout the new country, eventually becoming poker. And in a sense the theory of probability traveled apace with the game.

In the classic demonstration of the illusion of control, the Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer had students guess the outcome of a coin toss, heads or tails. They were then told whether they were correct or not in their guesses. In three separate setups, the outcomes were predetermined in a specific order: they could be distributed in an intuitively random pattern, there could be more correct guesses clustered near the beginning, or there could be more correct guesses clustered near the end. In each case, the absolute numbers were the same. The only difference was the order. But the results couldn’t have been more different. After the guesses concluded, Langer asked each participant a series of questions: Did they feel they could improve on this task? Did they feel they were particularly talented at it? Did they need more time to get better? Would they be better with limited distraction? And so on. In each case, the obvious answer is no: to answer otherwise is to classify something that is the outcome of chance (a coin toss) as being in the realm of skill. But the obvious answer is not the answer she got. When students had a random progression or one where the accuracy clustered near the end, they did indeed answer in the negative. But when the correct answers were clustered up front, they developed a sudden myopia. Why yes, they said, they are quite good at this, and yes, they would improve with time. Success led to an abject failure of objectivity: suddenly, they were in the throes of the illusion of control. They thought that they could actually predict the results of a coin toss.

Erik continues, “Somebody says, ‘Winning money.’ He says, ‘No.’ Somebody else says, ‘Winning a lot of pots.’ ‘No.’ He says, ‘The object of poker is making good decisions.’ I think that’s a really good way to look at poker.” He thinks for a bit. “When you lose because of the run of the cards, that feels fine. It’s not a big deal. It’s much more painful if you lose because you made a bad decision or a mistake.”

One hears a lot of talk about grooving one’s strokes in tennis. The theory is a simple one: every time you swing your racket in a certain way, you increase the probabilities that you will swing that way again. In this way patterns, called grooves, build up which have a predisposition to repeat themselves. Golfers use the same term. It is as if the nervous system were like a record disk. Every time an action is performed, a slight impression is made in the microscopic cells of the brain, just as a leaf blowing over a fine-grained beach of sand will leave its faint trace. When the same action is repeated, the groove is made slightly deeper. After many similar actions there is a more recognizable groove into which the needle of behavior seems to fall automatically. Then the behavior can be termed grooved.

It is a painful process to fight one’s way out of deep mental grooves. It’s like digging yourself out of a trench. But there is a natural and more childlike method. A child doesn’t dig his way out of his old grooves; he simply starts new ones! The groove may be there, but you’re not in it unless you put yourself there. If you think you are controlled by a bad habit, then you will feel you have to try to break it. A child doesn’t have to break the habit of crawling, because he doesn’t think he has a habit. He simply leaves it as he finds walking an easier way to get around. Habits are statements about the past, and the past is gone. There may be a deep groove in the nervous system which will take your forehand on the roll-over trip if you choose to step into that trench; on the other hand, your muscles are as capable as they ever were of swinging your racket through flat. There is no need to strain all the muscles in the arm to keep the racket flat; in fact, it requires fewer muscles to keep it flat than it does to roll it over. Fighting the fantasy of old habits is what causes the conscientious tennis player to strain and tighten unnecessarily. In short, there is no need to fight old habits. Start new ones. It is the resisting of an old habit that puts you in that trench. Starting a new pattern is easy when done with childlike disregard for imagined difficulties. You can prove this to yourself by your own experience. MAKING

Had I observed more hands, I would have realized at least one important thing: at this particular table, in this particular battle arena, people really like to fight. They’ve put on their military gear, and by god, they are going to go into battle. They didn’t come here to sit on the sidelines and watch while others do the fighting. They want to be in it themselves. Here, people really like to see flops and turns. They don’t often fold to bets; they want to see it all through to the river. That knowledge would have told me that the action was very likely to be multiway on most any hand. And that, in turn, would have informed my choice of weapons and tactics—stronger weapons, stronger positions, more select lines, but more aggressive ones once selected. Lines that can stand up to multiple attacks over multiple steps. For such a campaign, I would need hands with more robust equity—that is, hands that have the possibility of constant improvement—instead of my meek little weakling of a draw.

After all, I’d read that suitedness adds only 2 percent of equity to your hand, and boy, didn’t I feel good in that knowledge. Two percent is not a lot. It’s basically the same thing. Except it really isn’t. Any tactician or strategist would tell you immediately that any edge is huge, and 2 percent is a big deal. What’s more, suitedness makes something a far stronger weapon: it’s easier to play. You have an added psychological edge because now you can navigate many situations much more clearly.

“I thought I’d look weak if I just checked, that you’d tell me I need to be more aggressive. You told me not to play scared.” “First of all, you can’t think like that,” Erik tells me. “I mean, you actually are very weak here and you shouldn’t even be in this hand, but that’s not the point. The point is, you can’t play based on how it will look. Not playing scared is not the same thing as being aggressive. It means not making decisions because you’re afraid. It’s not about being passive or aggro. You can be way too aggro and still scared. And being passive can be strong.”

Watching the ball means to focus your attention on the sight of it. I have found that the most effective way to deepen concentration through sight is to focus on something subtle, not easily perceived. It’s easy to see the ball, but not so easy to notice the exact pattern made by its seams as it spins. The practice of watching the seams produces interesting results. After a short time the player discovers that he is seeing the ball much better than when he was just “watching” it. When looking for the pattern made by the seams one naturally watches the ball all the way to one’s racket and begins to focus his attention on it earlier than before. The ball should be watched from the time it leaves the opponent’s racket to the time it hits yours. (Sometimes the ball even begins to appear bigger or to be moving slower. These are natural results of true focus.) But seeing the ball better is only a partial benefit of focusing on its seams. Because the pattern made by the spinning ball is so subtle, it tends to engross the mind more completely. The mind is so absorbed in watching the pattern that it forgets to try too hard. To the extent that the mind is preoccupied with the seams, it tends not to interfere with the natural movements of the body. Furthermore, the seams are always here and now, and if the mind is on them it is kept from wandering to the past or future. The practice of this exercise will enable the tennis player to achieve deeper and deeper states of concentration.

It is perplexing to wonder why we ever leave the here and now. Here and now are the only place and time when one ever enjoys himself or accomplishes anything. Most of our suffering takes place when we allow our minds to imagine the future or mull over the past. Nonetheless, few people are ever satisfied with what is before them at the moment. Our desire that things be different from what they are pulls our minds into an unreal world, and consequently we are less able to appreciate what the present has to offer. Our minds leave the reality of the present only when we prefer the unreality of the past or future. To begin to understand my own lapses of concentration I had to know what I was really desiring, and it soon became clear to me that there were more desires operating in me on the court than simply to play tennis. In other words, tennis was not the only game I was playing on the court. Part of the process of attaining a concentrated state of mind is to know and resolve these conflicting desires; the following chapter attempts to shed light on this process.

“I’d have to play another match, and then another until I was beaten, which in a tournament like this was soon inevitable. Then I would return to my own club, report how I did, receive a few pats on the back, and soon all would again return to normal.” Staying in the tournament another round or two didn’t seem overwhelmingly attractive, so I asked myself a final question: “Then what do you really want?” The answer was quite unexpected. What I really wanted, I realized, was to overcome the nervousness that was preventing me from playing my best and enjoying myself. I wanted to overcome the inner obstacle that had plagued me for so much of my life. I wanted to win the inner game. Having come to this realization, knowing what I really wanted, I walked toward my match with a new sense of enthusiasm. In the first game, I double-faulted three times and lost my serve, but from then on I felt a new certainty. It was as if a huge pressure had been relieved, and I was out there playing with all the energies at my command. As it worked out, I was never able to break my opponent’s spinning, left-handed serve, but I didn’t lose my own serve again until the last game in the second set. I had lost 6–4, 6–4, but I walked off the courts feeling that I had won. I had lost the external game, but had won the game I had wanted to, my own game, and I felt very happy. Indeed, when a friend came up to me after the match and asked how I’d done, I was tempted to say, “I won!” For the first time I recognized the existence of the Inner Game, and its importance to me.

the surfer does want to ride the wave to the beach, yet he waits in the ocean for the biggest wave to come along that he thinks he can handle. If he just wanted to be “in the flow,” he could do that on a medium-size wave. Why does the surfer wait for the big wave? The answer was simple, and it unraveled the confusion that surrounds the true nature of competition. The surfer waits for the big wave because he values the challenge it presents. He values the obstacles the wave puts between him and his goal of riding the wave to the beach. Why? Because it is those very obstacles, the size and churning power of the wave, which draw from the surfer his greatest effort. It is only against the big waves that he is required to use all his skill, all his courage and concentration to overcome; only then can he realize the true limits of his capacities. At that point he often attains his peak. In other words, the more challenging the obstacle he faces, the greater the opportunity for the surfer to discover and extend his true potential. The potential may have always been within him, but until it is manifested in action, it remains a secret hidden from himself. The obstacles are a very necessary ingredient to this process of self-discovery. Note that the surfer in this example is not out to prove himself; he is not out to show himself or the world how great he is, but is simply involved in the exploration of his latent capacities. He directly and intimately experiences his own resources and thereby increases his self-knowledge.

This attitude can make a lot of changes in the way you approach a tennis match. In the first place, instead of hoping your opponent is going to double-fault, you actually wish that he’ll get his first serve in. This desire for the ball to land inside the line helps you to achieve a better mental state for returning it. You tend to react faster and move better, and by doing so, you make it more challenging for your opponent. You tend to build confidence in your opponent as well as in yourself and this greatly aids your sense of anticipation.

Until subdued, Self 1 is capable of producing fears, doubts and delusions wherever you are and whatever you are doing. Focus in tennis is fundamentally no different from the focus needed to perform any task or even to enjoy a symphony; learning to let go of the habit of judging yourself on the basis of your backhand is no different from forgetting the habit of judging your child or boss; and learning to welcome obstacles in competition automatically increases one’s ability to find advantage in all the difficulties one meets in the course of one’s life.

What else can be done to promote stability? The message of the Inner Game is simple: focus. Focus of attention in the present moment, the only one you can really live in, is at the heart of this book and at the heart of the art of doing anything well. Focus means not dwelling on the past, either on mistakes or glories; it means not being so caught up in the future, either its fears or its dreams, that my full attention is taken from the present. The ability to focus the mind is the ability to not let it run away with you. It does not mean not to think—but to be the one who directs your own thinking. Focusing can be practiced on a tennis court, chopping carrots, in a pressure-packed board meeting or while driving in traffic. It can be practiced when alone or in conversation. It takes as much trust to fully focus attention when listening to another person without carrying on a side conversation in your own head as it does to watch a tennis ball in all its detail, without listening to Self 1’s worries, hopes and instructions.

There’s a false sense of security in passivity. You think that you can’t get into too much trouble—but really, every passive decision leads to a slow but steady loss of chips. And chances are, if I’m choosing those lines at the table, there are deeper issues at play. Who knows how many proverbial chips a default passivity has cost me throughout my life. How many times I’ve walked away from situations because of someone else’s show of strength, when I really shouldn’t have. How many times I’ve passively stayed in a situation, eventually letting it get the better of me, instead of actively taking control and turning things around. Hanging back only seems like an easy solution. In truth, it can be the seed of far bigger problems.

We humans have wanted chance to be equitable for quite some time. Indeed, when we play a game in which chance doesn’t look like our intuitive view of it, we balk. Frank Lantz has spent over twenty years designing games. When we meet at his office at NYU, where he currently runs the Game Center, he lets me in on an idiosyncrasy of game design. “In video games where there are random events—things like dice rolls—they often skew the randomness so that it corresponds more closely to people’s incorrect intuition,” he says. “If you flip heads twice in a row, you’re less likely to flip heads the third time. We know this isn’t actually true, but it feels like it should be true, because we have this weird intuition about large numbers and how randomness works.” The resulting games actually accommodate that wrongness, so that people don’t feel like the setup is “rigged” or “unfair.” “So they actually make it so that you’re less likely to flip heads the third time,” he says. “They jigger the probabilities.” For a long time, Lantz was a serious poker player. And one of the reasons he loves the game is that the probabilities are what they are: they don’t accommodate. Instead, they force you to confront the wrongness of your intuitions if you are to succeed. “Part of what I get out of a game is being confronted with reality in a way that is not accommodating to my incorrect preconceptions,” he says. The best games are the ones that challenge our misperceptions, rather than pandering to them in order to hook players. Poker pushes you out of your illusions, beyond your incorrect comfort zone—if, that is, you want to win. “Poker wasn’t designed by a game designer in the modern sense,” Lantz points out. “And it’s actually bad game design according to modern-day conceptions of how video games are designed. But I think it’s better game design, because it doesn’t pander.” If you want to be a good player, you must acknowledge that you’re not “due”—for good cards, good karma, good health, money, love, or whatever else it is. Probability has amnesia: each future outcome is completely independent of the past. But we persist in thinking that its memory is not only there but personal to us. We’ll be rewarded, eventually, if we’re only patient. It’s only fair.

That we’re due to be in a certain part of the distribution, because our aces have already been cracked twice today. They can’t possibly fall yet again. We’ll forget what historian Edward Gibbon warned about as far back as 1794, that “the laws of probability, so true in general, [are] so fallacious in particular”—a lesson history teaches particularly well.

普通跑步者中，许多人都事先设定个人目标——这一次我要在多少多少时间之内跑完全程——然后再去挑战赛事。假如能在这个时间内跑完全程，就算“达成了某项目标”；如果未能跑出预定的成绩，就是“未能实现某项目标”。即便未能在预想的时间内跑完全程，只要有了业已尽力的满足感，或是为下次比赛奠定了些基础，抑或有了某种类似重大发现的东西，大约也算大功告成吧。换言之，在跑完全程时，能否感到自豪或类似自豪的东西，对于长跑选手而言，可能是最重要的。 同样的说法也适用于写作。小说家这一职业，至少对我来说，是无所谓胜负成败的。书的销量、得奖与否、评论的好坏，这些或许能成为成功与否的标志，却不能说是本质问题。写出来的文字是否达到了自己设定的基准，这，才至为重要；这，才容不得狡辩。别人大概怎么都可以搪塞，自己的心灵却无法蒙混过关。在这层意义上，写小说很像跑全程马拉松，对于创作者而言，其动机安安静静、确确实实地存在于自身内部，不应向外部去寻求形式与标准

虽然如此，自从年纪轻轻便结了婚(我结婚时二十二岁)，我渐渐习惯了和人共同生活。大学毕业之后经营一家饮食店，认识到了与他人相处的重要性。人无法独自生存下去，这本是理所当然，我却是脚踏实地学到的。尽管有点走样，我也渐渐掌握了类似社会性的东西。回想起来，从二十岁到三十岁的十年当中，我的世界观发生了不小的变化，在做人方面也有了一些长进。从四处碰壁之中，学会了生存的诀窍。倘若没有这也算得艰难的十年的生活体验，恐怕我就不会写什么小说了，即便想写，也写不出来。但话说回来，人的本性不会极端地发生变化。希望一人独处的念头，始终不变地存于心中。所以一天跑一个小时，来确保只属于自己的沉默的时间，对我的精神健康来说，成了具有重要意义的功课。至少在跑步时不需要和任何人交谈，不必听任何人说话，只需眺望周围的风光，凝视自己便可。这是任何东西都无法替代的宝贵时刻

The “big gambling casinos” weren’t exactly that. It wasn’t until Bugsy Siegel brought in the mob and built the Flamingo that Vegas started acquiring something of a more permanent sheen, as a place that wasn’t just on the way to Hollywood but somewhere Hollywood fantasies could come to life. And then Hollywood itself came to Vegas. In 1966, Howard Hughes, the reclusive millionaire mogul, moved into the Desert Inn—and bought the whole hotel rather than leave. He soon owned much of the town. And by the time Steve Wynn decided to build the Mirage, the first of the truly modern Vegas resorts, in 1989, the mob was all but replaced by Hollywood glitter. Vegas should have disappeared into desert. Instead, it became a living, walking fantasy.

While I liked playing the markets, I also loved playing around with my friends, whether in the neighborhood when I was a kid, using fake IDs to get into bars when we were teens, or, nowadays, going to music festivals and on scuba-diving trips together. I’ve always been an independent thinker inclined to take risks in search of rewards—not just in the markets, but in most everything. I also feared boredom and mediocrity much more than I feared failure. For me, great is better than terrible, and terrible is better than mediocre, because terrible at least gives life flavor.

Much as I loved the job and the people I worked with, I didn’t fit into the Shearson organization. I was too wild. For example, as a joke that now seems pretty stupid, I hired a stripper to drop her cloak while I was lecturing at a whiteboard at the California Grain & Feed Association’s annual convention. I also punched my boss in the face. Not surprisingly, I was fired. But the brokers, their clients, and even the ones who fired me liked me and wanted to keep getting my advice. Even better, they were willing to pay me for it, so in 1975 I started Bridgewater Associates.

Around this time, McDonald’s had conceived of a new product, the Chicken McNugget, but they were reluctant to bring it to market because of their concern that chicken prices might rise and squeeze their profit margins. Chicken producers like Lane wouldn’t agree to sell to them at a fixed price because they were worried that their costs would go up and they would be squeezed. As I thought about the problem, it occurred to me that in economic terms a chicken can be seen as a simple machine consisting of a chick plus its feed. The most volatile cost that the chicken producer needed to worry about was feed prices. I showed Lane how to use a mix of corn and soymeal futures to lock in costs so they could quote a fixed price to McDonald’s. Having greatly reduced its price risk, McDonald’s introduced the McNugget in 1983. I felt great about helping make that happen.

Before long, we became the first global inflation-indexed bond manager in the world. In 1996, U.S. Treasury deputy secretary Larry Summers began looking into whether the U.S. should issue its own inflation-indexed bonds, and because we were the only manager with a portfolio of such bonds, he called us in as experts. Dan and I traveled down to Washington to meet with Summers, his Treasury colleagues, and a number of representatives from well-known Wall Street firms. We were late (punctuality isn’t one of my strengths) and the doors to the big meeting room at Treasury were locked. I wasn’t going to let that stop me, so I knocked until someone opened it. It was a large room with a table in the middle and a press gallery off to the side. There was only one seat open at the table and it had Dan’s nameplate in front of it—we’d agreed that he’d be our one allowed representative since he’d done a lot of the prep work. I had forgotten that, so I walked over to the press gallery, grabbed a chair, and carried it next to Dan’s so I had a seat at the table too. Dan describes that meeting as an analogy for what it was like for us in the 1990s in general: We had to barge our way into things. Larry Summers has since said that the advice he got from us was the most important in shaping this market. When the Treasury did create the bonds, they followed the structure we recommended.

Learning how reality works, visualizing the things I want to create, and then building them out is incredibly exciting to me. Stretching for big goals puts me in the position of failing and needing to learn and come up with new inventions in order to move forward. I find it exhilarating being caught up in the feedback loop of rapid learning—just as a surfer loves riding a wave, even though it sometimes leads to crashes. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still scared of the crashes and I still find them painful. But I keep that pain in perspective, knowing that I will get through these setbacks and that most of my learning will come from reflecting on them.14 Just as long-distance runners push through pain to experience the pleasure of “runner’s high,” I have largely gotten past the pain of my mistake making and instead enjoy the pleasure that comes with learning from it. I believe that with practice you can change your habits and experience the same “mistake learner’s high.”

Whenever I observe something in nature that I (or mankind) think is wrong, I assume that I’m wrong and try to figure out why what nature is doing makes sense. That has taught me a lot. It has changed my thinking about 1) what’s good and what’s bad, 2) what my purpose in life is, and 3) what I should do when faced with my most important choices. To help explain why, I will give you a simple example. When I went to Africa a number of years ago, I saw a pack of hyenas take down a young wildebeest. My reaction was visceral. I felt empathy for the wildebeest and thought that what I had witnessed was horrible. But was that because it was horrible or was it because I am biased to believe it’s horrible when it is actually wonderful? That got me thinking. Would the world be a better or worse place if what I’d seen hadn’t occurred? That perspective drove me to consider the second- and third-order consequences so that I could see that the world would be worse. I now realize that nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual, but most people judge good and bad based only on how it affects them. What I had seen was the process of nature at work, which is much more effective at furthering the improvement of the whole than any process man has ever invented.

Most people have a tough time reflecting when they are in pain and they pay attention to other things when the pain passes, so they miss out on the reflections that provide the lessons. If you can reflect well while you’re in pain (which is probably too much to ask), great. But if you can remember to reflect after it passes, that’s valuable too. (I created a Pain Button app to help people do this, which I describe in the appendix.) The challenges you face will test and strengthen you. If you’re not failing, you’re not pushing your limits, and if you’re not pushing your limits, you’re not maximizing your potential.

e. Successful people are those who can go above themselves to see things objectively and manage those things to shape change. They can take in the perspectives of others instead of being trapped in their own heads with their own biases. They are able to look objectively at what they are like—their strengths and weaknesses—and what others are like to put the right people in the right roles to achieve their goals. Once you understand how to do this you’ll see that there’s virtually nothing you can’t accomplish. You will just have to learn how to face your realities and use the full range of resources at your disposal. For example, if you as the designer/manager discover that you as the worker can’t do something well, you need to fire yourself as the worker and get a good replacement, while staying in the role of designer/manager of your own life. You shouldn’t be upset if you find out that you’re bad at something—you should be happy that you found out, because knowing that and dealing with it will improve your chances of getting what you want.

You know about the randomness of it but it doesn’t help to think about it. You want to make sure you’re not the person in the poker room saying, ‘Can you believe what happened?’ That’s the other people.” I haven’t quite thought of it that way, but as always, the man has a point. How we frame something affects not just our thinking but our emotional state. It may seem a small deal, but the words we select—the ones we filter out and the ones we eventually choose to put forward—are a mirror to our thinking. Clarity of language is clarity of thought—and the expression of a certain sentiment, no matter how innocuous it seems, can change your learning, your thinking, your mindset, your mood, your whole outlook. As W. H. Auden told an interviewer, Webster Schott, in a 1970 conversation, “Language is the mother, not the handmaiden of thought; words will tell you things you never thought or felt before.” The language we use becomes our mental habits—and our mental habits determine how we learn, how we grow, what we become. It’s not just a question of semantics: telling bad beat stories matters. Our thinking about luck has real consequences in terms of our emotional well-being, our decisions, and the way we implicitly view the world and our role in it.

At the age of eleven, the same thing happened. I went to school, and on my way home, I decided that I wanted to sit down. The weather was cold and freezing, and I just sat down on a neighbor’s porch and slept. I don’t know what happened exactly, but apparently an ambulance arrived after someone telephoned to say they saw a young kid sleeping in freezing temperatures outside. I woke up in the hospital, and they kept me there for observation for a week. Again, I recovered, but I was aware that I could have died in either of those moments if someone hadn’t woken me and taken me into a warm area. The strange thing about hypothermia is that you don’t want to wake up; you just want to go to sleep. Why that is, I don’t know exactly, but those were my first encounters with the cold. And despite the very real danger they both posed, they were actually quite nice. I felt rosy. You go to sleep, and that’s it. Thank you very much, goodbye life. It’s okay. No worries. No fears. No nothing. Just a nice, rosy feeling.

Notice how it’s often the person who is the least invested in the success of something that actually ends up achieving it? Notice how sometimes when you stop giving a fuck, everything seems to fall into place? What’s with that? What’s interesting about the backwards law is that it’s called “backwards” for a reason: not giving a fuck works in reverse. If pursuing the positive is a negative, then pursuing the negative generates the positive. The pain you pursue in the gym results in better all-around health and energy. The failures in business are what lead to a better understanding of what’s necessary to be successful. Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others. The pain of honest confrontation is what generates the greatest trust and respect in your relationships. Suffering through your fears and anxieties is what allows you to build courage and perseverance.

Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.

When we say, “Damn, watch out, Mark Manson just don’t give a fuck,” we don’t mean that Mark Manson doesn’t care about anything; on the contrary, we mean that Mark Manson doesn’t care about adversity in the face of his goals, he doesn’t care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble. We mean that Mark Manson is the type of guy who would write about himself in third person just because he thought it was the right thing to do. He just doesn’t give a fuck.

I lived in those times, at the age of seventeen, in a squatter’s home. At that time in the Netherlands, squatting was somewhat of an accepted practice.1  Some people possess more property than they know what to do with, and for that, you get squatters. Squatters are people who just go in and say, “You’re speculating on this property to profit from the real estate market and, meanwhile, there’s nobody inside. That’s not right! It’s your property, but it’s living space, and we have no place to live. So we’ll take it for now and pay the gas and the electricity, and that’s it.” That was my feeling. I was a squatter, a protester. I believed that what was right was right and that we had an obligation to make what was wrong right or, at very least, stand up in opposition. And I lived there in that home as a squatter for eight years.

Happiness comes from solving problems. The keyword here is “solving.” If you’re avoiding your problems or feel like you don’t have any problems, then you’re going to make yourself miserable. If you feel like you have problems that you can’t solve, you will likewise make yourself miserable. The secret sauce is in the solving of the problems, not in not having problems in the first place.

The deeper the pain, the more helpless we feel against our problems, and the more entitlement we adopt to compensate for those problems. This entitlement plays out in one of two ways: 1.   I’m awesome and the rest of you all suck, so I deserve special treatment. 2.   I suck and the rest of you are all awesome, so I deserve special treatment.

Being “average” has become the new standard of failure. The worst thing you can be is in the middle of the pack, the middle of the bell curve. When a culture’s standard of success is to “be extraordinary,” it then becomes better to be at the extreme low end of the bell curve than to be in the middle, because at least there you’re still special and deserve attention. Many people choose this strategy: to prove to everyone that they are the most miserable, or the most oppressed, or the most victimized. A lot of people are afraid to accept mediocrity because they believe that if they accept it, they’ll never achieve anything, never improve, and that their life won’t matter. This sort of thinking is dangerous. Once you accept the premise that a life is worthwhile only if it is truly notable and great, then you basically accept the fact that most of the human population (including yourself) sucks and is worthless. And this mindset can quickly turn dangerous, to both yourself and others. The rare people who do become truly exceptional at something do so not because they believe they’re exceptional. On the contrary, they become amazing because they’re obsessed with improvement. And that obsession with improvement stems from an unerring belief that they are, in fact, not that great at all. It’s anti-entitlement. People who become great at something become great because they understand that they’re not already great—they are mediocre, they are average—and that they could be so much better.

There are approximately sixty-two thousand miles of veins, arteries, and capillaries in each and every one of us.3  The vascular system is constructed, after millions of years of evolution, with millions of little muscles that contract and open the veins and the vascular channels in reaction to the weather. Regardless of if it is warm or hot, our core body temperature has to remain 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. If your core temperature dips only 2 or 3 degrees below that, you go into hypothermia, a hypothermic state. If it dips 3 degrees or more than that, it’s irreversible; your core body temperature spirals down, and your body is no longer able to heat up. So, we have this vascular system that opens and closes to protect ourselves from the cold and heat, to remain within the range of normal body temperatures. It’s a very delicate system.

Cold showers are the gateway to flow and energy and peace. I’m not exaggerating. It’s the entry point from which you will learn the power of the mind over the body. If you do just ten days of cold showers after warm showers, meaning that you end your regular, warm showers with a minute or so of cold water, then you will be able to command your vascular system to close up when you go into the cold. It’s amazing what your body can do at will, and all it takes is ten days of these showers to regain your optimal vascular tone and achieve this control. As your vascular system awakens and its muscles begin to tone up, it forges a connection with your brain, with your will.

Are you one of those people who feels cold all the time? Would you like to be able to warm your body even when you don’t have access to an external heat source? If so, the following exercise can be done to activate brown fat tissue (or brown adipose tissue — BAT), which is capable of energy combustion, and your intercostal muscles. The intercostal muscles are several groups of muscles that run between the ribs and help move the chest wall during respiration. Activating them also generates heat. Do as follows: 1  Sit down. 2  Inhale slowly and deeply five or six times, letting your breath go naturally each time. 3  Inhale fully. 4  Relax to exhale. 5  Inhale fully. 6  Hold your breath, for no more than five seconds. 7  Tense your upper-back muscles and chest while you hold your breath — but don’t tense the head. Keep your jaw relaxed. 8  Let go. With practice, you will feel the heat flowing down from your neck to your whole body. Everybody is different, but with practice, you will feel the heat coming from inside your body. This is what I did to maintain my core body temperature during the experiments at Wayne State — but please do not try such experiments at home!

Shitty Values There are a handful of common values that create really poor problems for people—problems that can hardly be solved. So let’s go over some of them quickly: 1.   Pleasure. Pleasure is great, but it’s a horrible value to prioritize your life around. Ask any drug addict how his pursuit of pleasure turned out. Ask an adulterer who shattered her family and lost her children whether pleasure ultimately made her happy. Ask a man who almost ate himself to death how pleasure helped him solve his problems.                Pleasure is a false god. Research shows that people who focus their energy on superficial pleasures end up more anxious, more emotionally unstable, and more depressed. Pleasure is the most superficial form of life satisfaction and therefore the easiest to obtain and the easiest to lose.

Some examples of good, healthy values: honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity. Some examples of bad, unhealthy values: dominance through manipulation or violence, indiscriminate fucking, feeling good all the time, always being the center of attention, not being alone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich, sacrificing small animals to the pagan gods.

The first, which we’ll look at in the next chapter, is a radical form of responsibility: taking responsibility for everything that occurs in your life, regardless of who’s at fault. The second is uncertainty: the acknowledgement of your own ignorance and the cultivation of constant doubt in your own beliefs. The next is failure: the willingness to discover your own flaws and mistakes so that they may be improved upon. The fourth is rejection: the ability to both say and hear no, thus clearly defining what you will and will not accept in your life. The final value is the contemplation of one’s own mortality; this one is crucial, because paying vigilant attention to one’s own death is perhaps the only thing capable of helping us keep all our other values in proper perspective.

“The times I have my largest advantages over an opponent are when they think the story they’re telling makes sense—and I know that it doesn’t,” he tells me. “I know how they’d play certain hands better than they do.” As a writer, you always need to know what motivates your characters. Why are they doing what they’re doing? If you haven’t thought through the motivation, the behavior will be off. They’ll suddenly do things that make no sense. Their stories will veer into the unbelievable. In poker, it’s much the same thing.

“That’s my challenge to you,” Phil says. Never do anything, no matter how small it may seem, without asking why, precisely, you’re doing it. And never judge anything others do without asking the same question. “Every action your opponent takes has a reason behind it, whether conscious or unconscious,” he says. One of the most common things he hears from people who are starting out—and sometimes even veterans of the game—is how hard it is to play with bad players. They are impossible to read, the argument goes, because “they could have anything.” Not true, Phil argues. “Even terrible players make the plays they make for a reason, and it’s your job to figure it out,” he tells me. “When a hand is shown down, try to walk back through your opponent’s decision and come up with reasons they might have had for taking the actions they did.” Don’t judge them. Don’t berate them, even in your head, by thinking what an awful play they’ve made—a bad bet, a crazy call, an insane raise. Just try to figure out the why behind it.

WHEN I GET BACK from Vegas, a change, it seems, has already taken place. A few weeks later, I find my husband quietly observing me after I get off the phone with my speaking agency. I’ve just turned down an engagement—the first time I’ve ever done so in my entire speaking career—and told them that I was worth more than what they were offering. “Is everything OK?” I ask him. “You know, you take much less shit from people than you used to,” he says thoughtfully, with something I take for admiration. “That’s really good.” I smile. I may be a big swinging dick yet.
